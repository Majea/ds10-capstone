Stack’s spokesman Mark Albeiz said the senator remains supportive of the law and denied he would have withheld his vote to curry the governor’s favor. Stack would support Scutari’s resolution if it "clarified" how marijuana distributors were screened and how many distribution sites would be allowed, Albeiz said. "These concerns are not unreasonable for a senator who represents a congested urban district," he said.
But no one could imagine how eventful the journey would prove to be.
Star-studded casts certainly didn't hurt its popular runs in Paris (with Isabelle Huppert), London (Ralph Fiennes, Janet McTeer) and on Broadway (James Gandolfini, Marcia Gay Harden).

"When an appraisal comes in low, it puts doubt in the mind of the buyer as to the true value of that property," said Richard Kassouf, the broker-owner of New Hope Realty in Brunswick. "And it gives them a crisis that they have to deal with, where they have to come up with more money for the down payment to allow that transaction to be completed. Or they have to negotiate the price down."
But if FirstEnergy cannot argue its way out of the report's preliminary findings, Perry is headed for intensive and "most thorough" inspections and employee interviews, Mitlyng said. The NRC bills the utility for such inspections, she said, at the rate of $273 per hour for every inspector involved.

Palmer’s a welcome addition but she’s too tough for this movie — the effects are grade-school silly (Pettyfer shoots blue light from his hands like he’s clutching a fistful of glow sticks) and there’s no real threat. Stab one of the evil aliens with a special knife and he just turns to ashes.

Pippen writes about how he and the rest of the Bulls had to carry on when Jordan retired after the team's first three-peat, and how "it comes down to the players who are still out there coming together to collectively rise up as a group and win games. ... There was never a moment where we felt sorry for ourselves or let anyone push us into any self-doubt. We stayed positive and believed that if we stuck together and played good, hard defense, we could beat any team out there. That’s what I believe you can do as well."

Toni Malone's towering burgers may be the most ambitious in all of Los Angeles. Yet there are no contrivances here: no custom-ground meat blends, no willful denial of ketchup and no flavors fortified by what might otherwise amount to a chemistry experiment. Instead, the restaurant's signature burger is a tender, hand-formed turkey patty, a crispy lattice of turkey bacon, a firmly fried egg, a single slice of cheese, sweet mashed yams and wilted collard greens on a gently toasted sesame-seed bun. It's a triumph of maximalism, a burger in expert balance despite its seeming overabundance of ingredients.

It took Haberberger a few moments to collect herself as she took a shot to the hip bone when she made the play.

Now the immense forest, 250 miles north of the Bay Area, is beginning a rebirth of sorts. The BLM has been dutifully restoring Headwaters, roughly half of which is composed of untouched virgin timber. The other half was logged at one point or another as far back as the 1880s. BLM crews have eliminated 10 miles of old logging roads. They've conducted regular wildlife surveys for endangered spotted owls, salmon and other species (although it's too soon to see much change in animal numbers, they report). And they have thinned more than 1,000 acres of small Douglas fir trees to speed the return of massive redwoods.

But I did not yet know the meaning of the word exhausted. The Pentagon needs to figure out some strategic use for the Florida summer. It saps the strength of even the perkiest child, the most inveterate traveler. Still, with the misters and the air conditioning, with the spray bottles we brought (on advice from a Disney World website), we had a lovely time at Universal Orlando. Not only was the Wizarding World fantastic, but both Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios had many more and better rides than our local version does. The hotels are a five-minute boat ride away, and the room key acts as an Express Pass to many rides.
“I’m always a defender first, but when the game opens up hopefully I can attack the space and help Dane a little bit more, because whenever he got the ball in the first game they always had two guys covering him,” Solli said. “It was almost impossible for him to outrun his fullback, so if I can make it like a two-against-two challenge it will be easier for him. He has a great skill with his pace, and if you can get him into the back space that will open up the game and give us a lot of options.”
"I hope y'all are OK," perky Edwards said as pulverized Edwards listened.

Nowhere was this goal so sharply realized as at the Grand Canyon.

But Hillah, mostly Shiite and just a half-hour's drive away, was a prime target.

Through his first 10⅓ innings this season, Santana (1-1, 4.76 ERA) evoked hope by peppering inefficient appearances with glimmers of past greatness. Tonight was different, a full-out collapse that ended after 55 pitches (35 strikes). His shortest start with the Mets (7-4) before tonight was a three-inning, nine-run catastrophe at Yankee Stadium on June 14, 2009. This latest performance elicited more concern, considering his tenuous condition.

Exasperation over the growing public health implications of pollution inspired the call for environmental education and led to the first Earth Day celebration on April 22, 1970. Millions of Americans spanning diverse social, political and economic spectrums joined together, both in service and to protest the effects of oil spills, air pollution, raw sewage, toxic dumps, pesticides and wildlife extinction on American landscapes, waterways and skies. This movement ultimately resulted in the creation of the EPA and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts. Legislation soon followed to address the nation's drinking water supply, hazardous waste management and toxic waste cleanups.

In 1874, Shay, a former doctor who loved things mechanical, built his first locomotive. Six years later, he sold the construction rights to Lima Machine Works, which provided Shays for virtually every logging railroad in the country. Two similar designs — the Heisler and the Climax (and Cass has examples of both) — provided competition, but not much. With their small wheels and articulation, these geared locomotives could waddle sure-footedly over improvised, ungraded track, around tight curves and up hills that traditional rigid-frame steam locomotives with large driving wheels couldn't begin to tackle. Shays are not fleet of foot, despite the frantic flailing of their vertical pistons, but they are powerful.

Peeta asks Donald if he knows anything about the quickstep. Given his display of "DWTS" superfandom last week, I'm sure he does. Peeta says she's given Donald a very hard routine. In rehearsal, Donald drops into a split (impressive!) and them comes up wincing (ouch!). This song, "Stay the Night" by James Blunt, starts out so slow -- I hope it picks up or their quickstep is going to look really weird. Donald's kicks and flicks are high and high-energy. The song only ever briefly seemed to be as fast as they were dancing. Weird music selection there. Len apologizes to Donald and says that he undermarked Donald last week. Tom points out that this admission may be a first from Len.

He demonstrated his stellar skills at the NFL combine, giving teams a better look at what they can expect to see for years to come. Despite his large frame, Kalil ran the 40-yard dash in 4.99 seconds, which ranked second among offensive linemen. His speed and agility allow him to shift up and down the line quickly and pick up defenders in both the running and passing games. Kalil has a quick first step off the snap, allowing him to get into position immediately to either pick up the blitz or control his man on a run. That quickness combined with his size makes him difficult to beat and even more difficult to get away from once he's in control.
Let's add up just a few of the ways in which this is not necessarily true.

Cyclists on this route will definitely want to be fortified as they approach Bixby Bridge, the marathon's halfway point, and Hurricane Point, a mile south of the landmark structure. Completed in 1932, the span made from a single concrete arch stands more than 260 feet high and extends more than 700 feet across the canyon and Bixby Creek; for marathoners heading north, the bridge is a reward for the grueling two-mile climb up and rapid mile-long descent down the point. For those of us not in a rush, both the bridge and the summit of Hurricane Point, which offers sweeping prospects on non-foggy days, make obvious photo ops.

About 575 flights per day depart from JFK, though many of those are European flights that would head east over the Atlantic, while still others would head north or south. But half of all JFK’s proposed redesigned departure routes — six of 12 — would fly over the state’s north-central core, while two additional routes would send jets over the shore counties clear down to Delaware Bay.

For more than a decade, I have been arranging meetings between South Ossetians and Georgians -- schoolchildren, mothers, teachers and even soldiers -- to discuss the values we shared and the misunderstandings and hatred that have driven us apart.

The greatest risk to planes landing at night without controller assistance at a big airport like Washington's is that they might collide with equipment or maintenance workers since most runway maintenance work is performed overnight, Elwood said.
The authors also found that the way school administrators assign students to teachers — giving especially challenging students to a certain teacher and not to others, for example — could have skewed the value-added results.

Dunham, 25, plays Hannah, the most compelling character of the quartet. A slightly pudgy aspiring writer, Hannah seesaws between her sense of entitlement and self-loathing, which explains her willingness to repeatedly hookup with a narcissistic tool like Adam (Adam Driver). (Her sex scenes with him make your heart ache and your toes curl.)
If there is a connection between the timing of Mr. Johnson's arrest and the investigation into Mr. Nicholson, that's a real problem. Police have long focused on Mr. Johnson in the Barnes case, but they had not moved forward with an arrest, despite strong public pressure to do so. It would be terrible if, after all these months, authorities took action without having all the evidence they will eventually need.

Lars and Bianca in "Lars and the Real Girl" (2007): Ryan Gosling had a breakout year in 2011, but that's just when more people discovered him; he's always been good. This film is proof: He plays Lars, a shy man who announces to his brother and sister-in-law that he has a new friend named Bianca -- who is, in fact, an inflatable sex doll. Gosling is tremendous and heartbreaking, and the film an underrated gem.

Bower, though, thinks the book's portrait of Cowell is fairly positive.
There are two main Whitney routes: Up and Down, the standard 22-mile roundtrip, going in and out the same steep trail, which is what most people do. Or you can do what we did, and what the big kids do, which is to go Up and Over, starting at a distant trailhead, hiking a giant horseshoe-shaped route, and coming down the main trail. We would carry our packs and our body weight up a total of 8,320 feet, according to my cumulating altimeter watch.

2. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) Charles: Here is a film that actually was helped by Grant's performance, that of a confirmed bachelor who falls in love against his will. This is a funny, poignant look at a group of friends, their loves and their losses. Too bad Andie MacDowell had a major role. Simon Callow and John Hannah were an excellent couple, and Kristin Scott Thomas was good as the woman who loses out.
A: Hey, Dave: I think Heckert and Mike Holmgren have arrived at the realization that the team can't fill all its needs in the draft and that they have to use free agency more than they desired.

SIGHTSEEING. Commercial sightseeing excursions tend to be overpriced -- and they almost always make irritatingly long stops at souvenir shops chosen because of the kickbacks they give the tour company or tour guide. Moreover, a tour's pace is always dictated by the slowest member of the group -- and that can be agonizingly slow. Better alternatives:
The Buckeyes broke a 14-year victory drought at the Big House. Ohio State quarterback Craig Krenzel got his first start against Michigan in 2001, completing 11 of 18 passes for 118 yards. The native of Utica, Mich., was solid against the conference's No. 1 defense.

Washington and Arizona are locked in an intractable conflict over border security and immigration enforcement. The Obama administration has sued to block SB 1070, and the state has countersued the federal government for failing to secure the borders. But if the U.S. is going to end the poisonous stalemate over immigration, it must start with both sides coming together in Arizona.

That's better than another paper published earlier that year that looked at the 2002-05 period and found the game injury rate to be roughly double that, 111.3 per 1,000 athlete exposures, though that may be cold comfort for athletes currently sitting on the sidelines, waiting to heal.
Mayor Bing has talked about achieving that but never acted on it. The City Council has been even more negligent over a longer period of time about providing the basics of a functioning city to Detroiters.

Chopping Costs: Smaller private schools, including Muskingum and Heidelberg colleges (both in Ohio), have cut overall tuition instead of offering more aid.

* Some people are questioning Ken Hitchcock's decision to start Jaro Halak over Brian Elliott in Chicago? Really? I know Elliott had pitched three consecutive shutouts. We all love Elliott; he's been marvelous. But the Blues' head coach has been consistent about using two goaltenders during the regular season. And before last night, Halak had been in goal for one game since playing on March 17. What, is Hitchcock supposed to let Halak rot? Hitchcock is smart to keep both goaltenders sharp until it's time to make the call on the Game 1 starter in the first round.

Shehadeh's memoir describes six sarhat, walks on which a person "wanders aimlessly, not restricted by time and place, going where his spirit takes him to nourish his soul and rejuvenate himself." In describing walks taken through the countryside around Ramallah between 1978 and 2006, Shehadeh documents "a vanishing landscape" altered by conflict. The San Francisco Chronicle was moved by Shehadeh's method of "lyrically interweaving" his "personal search for connection with the soil with a sobering chronicle of Israeli West Bank settlement."

"A terrific win for our club," Pacers coach Frank Vogel said. "A gutsy playoff-type win. Holding them to 35 percent shooting is a strong defensive effort. They're a challenging team to guard."
He's also stingy with a lead, and the Giants gave him a 2-0 cushion right out of the box.

The 7-footer has played his way out of the rotation several times, so let's call his 15-point, seven-rebound effort what it was: a good game. He has rarely played with Kyrie Irving this season, but they were an effective duo against the looser than creamed corn Wizards defense.
The Big Ten tournament differentiated among the three regular-season champions. Michigan's banner won't be any smaller than what they will raise in East Lansing and Columbus, and the keepsake caps and T-shirts aren't hand-me-downs.

Such projects may be the group's great dilemma. State officials believe optional toll lanes are among the best tools to offer regional congestion relief, serving exactly the function the regional referendum was meant to provide. By charging a toll that rises with congestion, they keep out people who can't afford it, thus creating one thing that does not currently exist in metro Atlanta: the choice of a reliably congestion-free lane, spanning a long distance.

His claim for presidential apologies, however, is at odds with Obama's actual statements. We read through Obama's speeches and public remarks while traveling abroad but could not find a statement that included the words "sorry" or "apologize." Instead, Obama's remarks contained some criticism of past U.S. actions, but those passages were typically balanced by praise for American ideals, and Obama mentioned how other countries have erred as well. We've rated Romney's statement Pants on Fire.
At the time, I worked in downtown Portland and usually I commuted by bus. I believe the light-rail system is beneficial in several ways. It helps the environment by getting some cars off the road.

If Obama wins re-election, he will have Putin as a sometime partner and sometime adversary through the end of his presidency. If Republican Mitt Romney wins, the dynamic might be very different.

In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote – and we will push to get it passed.

They were also successful 71 percent of the time.

With apologies to Mencken, the Manhattan is more complex than the martini and more flavorful.

Role: Miller's Blazers tenure got off to a rocky start, but by the end of last season Miller had endeared himself to teammates and fans with his no-nonsense approach and rugged game. He arguably was the team's MVP last season and will be counted on to provide veteran savvy, floor leadership and scoring as the starting point guard in 2010-11. Concerns remain about his on-court chemistry with Brandon Roy, but when the duo is clicking, they form a dynamic backcourt.

Portland residents may decide the costs are well worth the benefits. The city has many excellent schools and many improving ones, even under today's conditions. With schools in disarray, Portland is less able to attract and retain good employers, less able to graduate productive citizens, less able to maintain its quality of life. As most major American cities have learned the hard way, it's almost impossible to get the schools back once they're gone.
"Bridesmaids" (Universal Studios Home Video, not rated/R, DVD $29.98; Blu-ray Disc $34.98). Raunchy and embarrassing (especially in mixed company), this gutter-mouthed comedy is also funny at times. Kristen Wiig of "Saturday Night Live" stars and co-wrote the script, which is why it has a late-night comic's dysfunctional view of relationships. The good themes about friendship and loyalty are undercut by Wiig's toxic take on female rivalry. Her character comes unhinged when her lifelong friend (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and brings a too-perfect new female acquaintance into the inner circle. If you like graphic depictions of what used to be called human intimacy and think nothing is funnier than explosive diarrhea, this one's for you. The new DVD includes both the theatrical cut and an unrated version with deleted footage. The cast joins director Paul Feig on a commentary track that pretty much excludes us from the fun, but it does explain why the film's setting is so jarring: Some of the exteriors were shot in Milwaukee and others in Chicago. Chi-waukee, anyone?

Young musicians are battling uphill. With each passing year, the "buzz" musicians at the conference get older and more established. Claire Boucher, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter who performs under the name Grimes, was typical of past artists who have distinguished themselves at the festival: fashionable, experimental, somewhat opaque and still very much under construction.

Of course I have. I've been to Brussels, lifelong home of Tintin's creator, Georges Prosper Remi, better known by his comic book nom de plume, Hergé. Fans and scholars of the strip — a serious tribe known as Tintinologists — may recall an often-reproduced photo of Hergé, posed with a natty cane and bowler hat at the market on the Place du Jeu de Balle in the funky-chic Marolles district of Brussels, where collectors sell vintage postcards, dubious Old Master paintings, threadbare Oriental rugs, broken lamps and model ships just like the one Tintin finds at the opening of the film.

But getting back to business and strictly business, Pujols will help a team that's been known as the Los Angeles Angels, the California Angels, the Anaheim Angels and, finally — for now — the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, strengthen its identity in Southern California.

The Pew Environment Group commissioned a task force of 18 scientists to examine the issue of Gulf restoration. In a report published last September, the investigators found that the Deepwater Horizon blowout was just the most visible, recent problem. Chronic overfishing, poorly planned coastal development, and pollution -- according to the researchers' final report -- had already seriously degraded the area's ecological resilience. Consequently, to move toward effective long-term recovery, federal and state managers must apply a holistic approach to restoration across the region. A dedicated funding source and associated management mechanism are needed, though, to facilitate this change.

Russo and his willing confederates deserve whatever punishment they receive from the federal courts. But they leave behind much collateral damage that can be repaired only through an end to the virtual one-party rule by Cuyahoga County Democrats that enabled Russo and his cronies to thwart any realistic checks and balances for so long, and an even more diligent house-cleaning of county government than the one already under way as part of charter reforms voters enacted last year.

Yet, even with a resilience built over nearly two centuries as outsiders, church members are anxious about what's ahead. Republican Mitt Romney is about to become the first Mormon nominee for U.S. president on a major party ticket.

Khoury, mentioned in recent years as a contender for literature's Nobel Prize, has set most of his stories in Lebanon and Palestine. His best-known novel, "Gate of the Sun," is a sprawling look at post-1948 Palestine.

Colson's outspokenness on behalf of that last group, along with his forceful defense of man-woman marriage and rebukes of everything from moral relativism and aggressive secularism to the spread of euthanasia and Internet pornography, ranked as scandalous in many minds as his Nixon-era offenses. His refusal to bow to the gods of political correctness probably explains why Beltway pundits who easily forgave Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton their misdeeds never could accept the authenticity of a rehabilitated Chuck Colson.

Later, Staci wakes up. The two new mothers are no longer captives, they've presumably ascended to heaven with their babies. It's revealed all along the women had been in Purgatory, after having died on the operating table of abortion clinics.

On the flip side, some major names were remarkably precise. The 2008 Migration Russian River Valley Chardonnay from Duckhorn was spot-on: 14.1 percent tested and on the label. And the 2006 Robert Mondavi Reserve Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon lists an alcohol of 15.5 percent, essentially the same as its tested result of 15.46. That seems painfully high for a wine that once landed in the mid-13s, but the number is accurate.
Trayvon, 17, was killed Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. when Zimmerman, a member of a neighborhood watch group, shot the unarmed teen.

Trayvon was African-American; Zimmerman is Latino.

The economy turned in another lackluster month for job creation in April, with 115,000 net new jobs, 130,000 in private business (less 15,000 fewer in government). The unemployment rate fell a tick to 8.1%, albeit mainly because the labor force shrank by 342,000. This relates to what is arguably the most troubling trend in the April jobs report, which is the continuing decline in the share of working-age Americans who are in the labor force.

In Shanksville, Pa., where United Flight 93 crashed in a field with a force so great it shook the school three miles away, the memories of 9/11 have never faded, even though textbooks there don't mention the attacks because they are about a decade old.

The guides were controversial all over the country, of course. Some politicians, even Democrats, thought the writers' project was a Communist plot. And as it's revealed on the title page, "Los Angeles" was co-sponsored by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, maybe we should be grateful that what we got is as good as it is. The guide remains addictively readable and features, as Kipen notes, sheaves of "dazzling monochrome photography" from the likes Julius Shulman and Fred William Carter. It's still alive and has become big history in the debate it set out to report, the one that asks the questions: What exactly is L.A., and whither goes it?

I think Anna's movement has been fantastic. It's everything I wanted to happen. In fact it's happened a little sooner than I expected. At the same time, I think it's not exactly a "revolution." It was only a successful protest since the former goes on for a while. Two years back when I started writing columns, I would have been considered a lunatic for imagining the India I would like to see. But when I see a movement like this, I think there are plenty of people who want an equal society based on excellence. It's very nice that the youth lent their time and energy to the cause. But you can't fix a nation in 10 days. The youth has to be prepared to sacrifice more if they want to see a better nation.

But Obama has hitched his political fate and the economy's on his jobs plan. It would have extended and expanded payroll tax cuts, provided continued jobless benefits to the long-term unemployed, helped keep teachers and police officers on the job and paid for tens of billions of dollars in public works projects. The legislation would have paid for it all with a surtax on millionaires. Obama has said he will now seek to divvy up the bill and seek passage of its component parts.

The limit — now at $166,000 — was not raised for 10 years, and it hampered BOCES’ recruitment efforts, said Robert Lowry, deputy director of the New York State Council of School Superintendents. He said of the 37 BOCES, more than 10 have had vacancies at the same time, and the Western Suffolk County BOCES has had no superintendent for several years. “They basically gave up on trying to find someone,” Lowry said.

The move could either bolster Rubio's appeal to be Romney's running mate at a time when the presumptive nominee is struggling mightily with Hispanic voters. Or it could lead to a divisive internal debate within the GOP and wound the rising star's standing on the right.
In south St. Louis and near suburbs, the storms uprooted giant trees, snapped thick limbs and dumped so much water so quickly that the low areas of Interstate 55 near Gasconade Street and Highway 40 (Interstate 64) near McKnight Road were temporarily impassible because of flooding.

Besides gardenias, they attack other woody landscape plants such as azalea, rhododendron, euonymus and liquidambar. The adults attack foliage while the larvae feed on roots.
Barry Bonds always will be a Hall of Fame candidate. He surely is one of the 10 best players of his generation and probably several others. But will he be a Hall of Famer? That is a question I don't have to worry about answering for another three years or so, until he would become eligible. The biggest question of all, though, may be how would the Hall of Famers receive Bonds if he were elected?. My guess is not very well. American is a forgiving nation but Bonds, and for that matter, Roger Clemens, have shown very little if any contrition for their actions or suspected actions. That creates the sense that they feel they are bigger than the game. And they're not.
Pizzeria Ortica in Costa Mesa puts more emphasis on the pizzas, though the menu also offers the gamut of antipasti, salads, pastas and main courses. This is Sona and Comme Ça owner David Myers' first foray into Italian, with Steve Samson, whom you might remember as chef at Valentino a few years back, as chef de cuisine. Samson has made it his business to get the dough right, using a 300-year-old biga or sourdough starter from outside Naples, Italy (wonder how he got that baby through customs?). The thin crust has wonderful flavor and picks up some smokiness from the oven. Consider the Calabrese with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, rapini, hot little Calabrese peppers and shaved bottarga (dried pressed roe). The Margherita is classic, and you can add prosciutto and wild arugula to it, or salami and mushrooms. But the most unusual is the pie topped with fresh ricotta, guanciale, scallions and a dusting of fennel pollen. The place also has some terrific antipasti, such as house-cured yellowfin tuna with borlotti beans, charred octopus with potatoes and celery or carciofi (artichokes) alla Romana. Note: On the first and third Saturday of every month, Samson will be teaching a pizza class at the restaurant.

For awhile there, missed tackles and sloppy defense were costing Howard points and wins. But the Lions really got their show together down the stretch, holding high powered Reservoir and Hammond to only 13 combined points in the last two weeks, to get into the postseason.

Iranian conductor Farhad Mechkat, flown in from Tehran and given a hero's welcome by the audience, led a performance of Kodály's "Dances of Galanta" to start.

There was no forced growth here; he allowed the music to bloom, and bloom it did. It seemed perfect for Nowruz.

2. Only go with T-Rich if J-Black is gone: The only way the Browns should draft Trent Richardson is if Blackmon is taken as the third pick. Granted, Richardson is fantastic, but he's a running back, and I believe you can get a good one -- such as Boise State's Doug Martin -- later. It's pass-happy league now, and the Browns need to join the aerial party.

PORTLAND, Ore. — When Occupy Wall Street protesters took over two parks in Portland's soggy downtown, they pitched 300 tents and offered free food, medical care and shelter to anyone. They weren't just building, like so many of their brethren across the nation, a community to protest what they see as corporate greed.
The broad outlines of the policy-heavy state budget stayed unaltered by the committee: A half-dozen state prisons will be sold; the state’s liquor operations privatized; and the door opened for future lease of the state turnpike.

Tóibín is strong at depicting the way restrained passion works. But leaving Enniscorthy has not allowed Eilis to be suddenly transformed into a woman fully in touch with her feelings or capable of expressing them. She moves more slowly than Tony, and intimacy is strange territory for her, but she seems almost ready to let go, breaking the grip of her past, when she is summoned back to Enniscorthy.

The show (Season 5 premieres at 8 p.m. Tuesday on Style) features the so-clearly-happily-in-love husband and wife balancing their busy careers with domestic life and becoming even closer as Giuliana battles breast cancer and eventually has a double mastectomy.

All you have to do is go to Puente Hills and stand atop (California's) biggest man-made structure, a mountain of garbage 500 feet tall, with a plateau at the top that could swallow Dodger Stadium, parking lot and all, and you know there's got to be a better way of dealing with our garbage.
It's one thing for the Illinois High School Association to question if defensive end Charles Tigue lives within the boundaries of District 189, and another for the Association to investigate the transfers of quarterback Lamontiez Ivy (from Cahokia) and running back Anthony Pierson (from St. Louis Gateway Tech), but what justifies Coach Darren Sunkett spouting off about his opposition?

What's interesting about these works is that they are all by (putatively) serious people: a vice presidential nominee, two national political reporters, a key aide to a presidential candidate, the first lady of a state. And yet their insights, such as they are, come off like the witless name-calling of a schoolyard fight. Gossip, innuendo, infidelity, accusations -- that's the best this group of exemplary citizens can stir up.
Even residents admit the complaining does smack of typical not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) protests.

Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who had been facing the first significant challenge in years to his seat representing an area outside of Houston, reportedly told allies in the House on Monday night that he would step aside so another Republican could pursue the seat. DeLay, under indictment in Texas in connection with a campaign finance plan and tied to the Abramoff lobbying case, has become the poster boy for ethical scandals surrounding the GOP. Former Democratic Rep. Nick Lampson is running for the seat. Lampson represented more than 20 percent of the district's voters under the old borders that DeLay helped redraw with an unusual mid-decade redistricting, which cost Lampson his seat.
Bucking bales 11 hours a day at a ranch near Soledad, they share quarters with the cowboy Slim (a deft turn by Chad Deverman), the callous Carlson (Michael Ray Wisely) and the kindly old Candy (Gary Martinez), who lost a hand working on the farm and got $250 in compensation. The ranch hands have been hardened by their way of life, but still try to eke out a few moments' pleasure. They play cards, tell tall tales and gawk at the boss's daughter-in-law (Lena Hart) -- the only unnamed character in the story -- while avoiding her hotheaded husband, Curley (Harold Pierce).

In the one-liner category, the show displays a taxidermy kitten that stands upright in a display case and brandishes a placard declaring, "I'm Dead." Created by English artist David Shrigley, the piece draws a contrast between the cuddly appeal of a stuffed animal and a blunt verbal message. Dark, cynical humor -- with a sophomoric edge -- is definitely part of being human.
The country is only 110 miles wide at its average width, but stretches 2,700 miles long, more than half the length of South America. It is surrounded by natural barriers: the ocean to the west, the Atacama Desert to the north (the world's driest desert), the Andes Mountains to the east, and the Patagonian Ice Fields to the south that claim a part of Antarctica. Soils and topography are deep and diverse. The barriers make Chile virtually free of pests.

Each morning begins with an alfresco buffet of Oregon berries, pastries and artisanal meats. At a previous IPNC I attended, a Chinese woman led the breakfast group in tai chi, and I knew it was the only healthy thing I'd do all weekend. You can scarcely go 10 minutes without serious ingestion. It's a constant exercise in pacing without a pacing of exercise. The wine, some of it from the previous century, never stops; wherever you turn -- on lawns, under gleaming white tents and in shady groves -- vintners are pouring their estate and reserve bottles, while iced San Pellegrino is available in tubs, a necessity in the withering heat.
In his memoir, "This Wheel's on Fire," Helm said some hard feelings about Robertson also included his getting songwriting credits on Band songs that other members considered group efforts.

Carl said Tuesday that his district had submitted the paperwork to get the casino money and was waiting to hear back.
They have reacted, however, in what I can only assume are hostile ways. One night, we found a giant bullfrog (dead) in my office. Wilbur subsequently waddled in with a mole in his mouth (also dead). Previously, we had only been given mice as presents. Now they seem to be moving on to bigger things. We hope these are not subtle messages.
A Granite City restaurant that serves barbecue specialties like the Smoke Detector and the Firehouse Combo may seem ready to take some awards for serving up good eats.
"As years go by, we as police officers become hardened and cynical; we sometimes lose focus on the true purpose and reason for our mission," Isom said.

Ants go up the tree to harvest the sweet sap that aphids suck out of the leaves. To stop the ants, put a 6-inch band of duct tape around the trunk of each tree about 6 inches above the soil level. Coat this band with Tanglefoot, available at nurseries and home improvement stores. The ants can't cross this sticky substance. You will have to redo this process when the product is no longer sticky due to dust, water, etc.

The Irish government protests it doesn't need aid, at least not yet, because it has sufficient funds through mid-2011 and is planning euro6 billion ($8 billion) in 2011 cuts and tax hikes. However, it has suggested that direct EU aid to its cash-strapped banks would boost Ireland's creditworthiness, since the government has guaranteed the banks' financial obligations.
"You need every single permit, and every one of them is a nightmare," said Tom Cannon, who formerly built such projects for Wildlands Inc.

Speaking of food, hotel and restaurant meals add up quickly for families. If you don't have access to free breakfast and nibblies in hotels with club levels (such as the newly remodeled club at the Sheraton and Hyatt in Waikiki), keep in mind the food courts at Royal Hawaiian Center (upper level) and the Waikiki Shopping Plaza (underground), which have a mix of "local," Asian and mainland mall-style options.

Mt. Hood Skibowl, the resort where I was skiing when I crashed, is owned and run by some thoughtful souls. Because I can't ski again yet, they arranged to cart me around on a snowmobile. And at my request, they took me to my crash site and described what they remembered about the incident. (Thanks to Kirk, Hans and Troy for making this possible. And if you can afford to, go ski for me. It was all too quiet up there. The mountain is saddled with this economy, too.)

Covered in pale shades of reflective glass, the CityCenter is an imposing surprise (yes, even Vegas has surprises) in a stretch of neon-lit faux-European structures. It must have looked dynamic to architects on a miniature scale, but in real life, it's difficult for visitors on the ground to distinguish which buildings are which and whether any of them even want you to come inside.

Medical infectious disease specialists note that misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture clearly produces dangerous drug-resistant bacteria.

The best parts of the film, for me, came toward the end, when the lives of the four lovers become bittersweet and melancholy. They were so happy for a time. They were inseparable. Now it is all over. There's a flashback where they walk together down to the farm pond to wash off the flour. As they dry contentedly in the sun, Teri still has a little flour behind her ear. You can't do better than that.

In ancient Rome, rape of a woman was tantamount to end of any hope of honorable life and "honor killing" was considered a sympathetic act of the family members. Roman law Pater familias provided complete power to the men of the family over their children and wives. Ancient Roman Law condoned killing women who had committed adultery by their husbands. For long time in Greece, the laws provided powers to husbands over wives as women were believed to be socially below the men. In many ancient cultures including Babylonian, Egypt, Native American and Persian cultures, women convicted of infidelity were given harsh sentences. Chinese husbands would cut off the hair of wives accused of illicit relationships and crush them to death by elephants.

By "Fables of the Reconstruction," (1985) the band's third album, the haze was lifting. R.E.M. became defenders and poets of the American south, incorporating elements of colloquial speech into its songs ("Good Advices," "Can't Get There From Here") . Stipe also became an ardent critic of the Reagan Administration. "Document," the band's most overtly political album, was also its commercial breakthrough. Released in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal, "Welcome to the Occupation" assailed American intervention in Central America; "Exhuming McCarthy" drew a connection between the Red Scare and then-contemporary foreign policy; "Disturbance at the Heron House" poked fun at the arrogance of the establishment. "It's the End of the World As We Know It" was not an explicitly political song, but it shook the skeleton of Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues."

Although he has only been in the kitchen since Easter, the results are impressive, starting with a range of raw vegetables accompanied by an intensely smoky baba ganoush, the existing Petersham brand of extra virgin olive oil and pita bread. The experience only gets better with his signature spiced rabbit and chorizo with parsnip and skordalia (a Greek garlic and potato dip), all covered with grumolo verde chicory. The best dish of all was a large duck bistayeea, a delicious pastry-covered pie with layers of duck and Moroccan spices, which was partially inspired by a dish Ms. Gyngell served using pigeons. These, and his other dishes like braised fennel with Turkish chili and walnut crumbs, or an exquisite slow-cooked lamb shoulder, were executed with considerable skill and rigor.
For the Murdochs, it was a chance to make a public atonement for the allegations that the News of the World illegally accessed the private voice mails of potentially thousands of people, including not just celebrities and political bigwigs but also murder victims and fallen soldiers.

It also requires new employees to contribute 9 percent of their pay to their pensions, and refunds just 25 percent of that when each firefighter retires. In the past, they contributed 8 percent, and got all of it refunded.

Manny saw the ball. He hit the ball. It didn't matter how hard you threw it or how much you bent it or if you threw it at him. Sooner or later, he would hit it so far it would make your spine tingle.
"So this kind of backhanded way of saying they care about cities and local governments, meanwhile robbing them blind," Turner said. "If this is what the Republican Party calls looking out for local government, they are a dollar short and a day late. It is absolutely shameful."

More coverage: The Internet buzzed after Kate Middleton and the fictional Bella Swan (in the "Twilight" movie) wore wedding gowns with long sleeves. Would strapless gowns topple from their perch? Not exactly. "You put a sleeve in the gown and to get a beautiful fit you need a tight armhole, and that really eliminates movement," Durham said.

Cap sleeves are gaining popularity, as are illusion necklines, as in a strapless dress with a sheer overlay that rises to a boat neck. Longer veils are back, too. More than three in every four women in a David's Bridal survey conducted last fall planned to wear a veil. Many brides are wearing their hair partially down with a veil, as did Middleton, for a modern twist.

Wisconsin's Supreme Court race this spring is likely to intensify the already heated national debate over judicial selection in the states. From the hyperbolic rhetoric in media reports, one would think that the very legitimacy of state courts is at stake when ignorant voters are allowed to decide whether judges should retain their jobs.

Jennifer Aniston brings a needed liveliness to "Derailed," though not enough to go around. She's Lucinda Harris, a financial planner who embarks on an affair with Clive Owen's Charles Schine, a TV commercial executive with sufficient stress in his home life to explain why he responds to Lucinda's wry ministrations.

First they're terrorized by a thug, Phillippe Laroche, played to the psychotic hilt by Vincent Cassel. Then Charles, who is both a hunk and something of a wimp, struggles to act like a man when Laroche turns high-stakes blackmailer.

Jedward kept up their mix of interesting stage performances and less than stellar vocals until they were finally eliminated during week seven of the competition. But in what could be considered a sad twist of fate for good singers struggling to make ends meet, Jedward scored a record contract. In fact, they have already released two albums, both of which went number one in their home country of Ireland. They were even selected to represent Ireland at the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest, with one of the catchiest songs I've heard in awhile, "Lipstick." Once again, the vocals were horrible, but something about the whole stage performance got Europe to vote for Jedward, once again proving that just because you can't sing doesn't mean you don't have the X Factor.

I walk my dogs most mornings at a particular greenbelt area. Along the way I meet Bonnie the pitbull and her "dad"; Harley the Australian shepherd and her mom; Anubis the Labrador and his dad; the "parents" of Newfie Buddha, Australian cattle dog Sally, shiba inu Shibi and many others. We always stop to talk with each other while our dogs meet and greet. There's nothing like a happy-go-lucky dog to help break the ice and get people talking. If your daughter is shy, this would be a great way for her to meet people and break out of her shell. Dogs are terrific therapists in this regard.

Smith: Again, I want to be really, really disciplined about making budgetary commitments absent knowing what's happening. I've done that consistently. The criteria I'd use -- where are we getting our best R.O.I., where are we getting our best bang for the buck? And where are the areas with a high benefit, where we seem to be underinvesting, relative to similarly situated cities? We are right now underinvesting in the arts. That doesn't mean in a down budget we can promise to spend more -- we can't even promise to spend the same if we are cutting everything -- but we should keep in mind that we are not investing enough. The other thing I'd add is that we shouldn't limit our thinking to our ambit of control. We also need to consider our ambit of influence, that the mayor has the ability to work with regional partners and other local governments to help build the whole pie. The mayor also has the ability to go to Salem. The fact that I'm the one current elected official in this race and the only candidate who has served in the Legislature will be an advantage to leverage other partners so we can build and maintain overall arts funding.

Poe wore his hair a little long, and a mustache.

So much better than the "Rat Pack" original. It's too bad the two sequels stunk up the joint.

Maybe the best we can do for now is to adopt the transparent approach of John Calipari, the Kentucky coach. He makes no apologies for what he does.

By asserting that the very purpose of faith -- and the "core struggle of human nature" -- is to strive for closer adherence to the "law of love" in our relations with one another, Obama essentially neutralizes religious difference. Whatever one's belief system -- whether religious or secular -- it all boils down to the same crystallized essence: an "irreducible" something, as he puts it, which is simple and universal. It is the common ideal embodied in the Golden Rule.

But “New York is Killing Me” sports a truly inventive, percussion-heavy arrangement, and there’s a seductive charm to the title track, which backs Scott-Heron’s crooning with a gently rolling guitar riff. Scott-Heron’s take on Brook Benton’s “I’ll Take Care of You” is dignified and deeply soulful. The most important thing about this album, of course, is that its existence suggests that Scott-Heron’s life is back in order. But tracks like these suggest that he still has some musical revelations to offer, as well.
Wal-Mart said results are improving because U.S. customers are beginning to respond to its turnaround strategies. After consumers balked at popular brand names and other merchandise they want being missing from store shelves, the company has been restocking those items that it had scrapped in an overzealous move to clean up stores. And its returning to a philosophy of everyday low pricing instead of slashing prices temporarily on select merchandise is resonating with its financially-strapped customers.

The GOP, in large part, isn't displaying its usual anti-gay election-year demagoguery, and not just in the "pledge." As recently as 1995, a Republican-controlled Congress was holding hearings investigating "homosexual recruitment" and the "promotion" of homosexuality. During the George W. Bush administration, the party used its fervent opposition to marriage for gay and lesbian couples as a get-out-the-vote strategy, encouraging more than a dozen anti-gay state ballot initiatives geared at driving turnout in the 2004 election and engineering repeated efforts to pass an amendment to the Constitution. This year is the first election year in recent history in which anti-gay rhetoric has been significantly muted: No state is facing an anti-gay initiative on the ballot, and marriage has not been a focus of the national conservative agenda.

In more than half of U.S. housing markets, the rent yield is over 10%. That's a gross yield; buyers should subtract for things like taxes and maintenance. But even so, buyers in most markets will end up with yields of over 5%. That's a pretty good deal at a time when 10-year corporate bonds of decent credit quality pay only 3%. And with the average 30-year mortgage rate sitting below 4%, financing terms are attractive relative to rent yields (for buyers who can get loans).

Which brings me back to Jocelyn, who worked for The Bee from 2003 to 2008 and covered poverty. Her work for us included a 2007 three-day narrative serial called "Tackling Life," in which she tracked down 31 of 35 members of the 1992 Raiders Junior Midgets football squad. The idea started with an old photograph  the picture included LaMarr Alexander, who had been killed by police in a confrontation after a car chase  but was broadened as Jocelyn began wondering what had happened to all the boys in the picture. All 12- and 13-year-olds at the time, many came from rough neighborhoods dealing with poverty, drugs and violence. Her findings reflected that background.

This car might be your worst nightmare. A plug-in hybrid electric luxury sedan that costs more than $100,000, from a California company—Orange County, but still—which has borrowed $169 million from taxpayers as part of the Department of Energy's advanced-vehicle-technology loan program; a car built not in the heartland but the socialist paradise of Finland; a car that, with the arithmetic all in, averages 52 mpg-e (that's the EPA's metric for plug-in hybrid EVs), which means that for all its fancy-dancy lithium-iron-phosphate star drive, it gets about the same fuel economy as a conventional Prius hybrid.

What makes the movie work is the stars' willingness to do anything for a laugh; think of the hair-gel scene for proof.

What would make anticipating pride so much better than anticipating shame in controlling temptation? One reason is that pride focuses attention on the self (not the cake) and on success rather than failure. Shame, on the other hand, emphasizes the opposite; it focuses attention on the object of desire and the act of succumbing, making resistance harder to pull off. Simply put, anticipating pride makes us feel good, and anticipating shame makes us feel bad.

 Some of the defendants did say things that perhaps they shouldnt have said .. but they had a right to say it, Weiss told the Free Press today, saying its unfortunate that people are getting indicted for speaking their minds. Its the thought police.

Given demographic trends in the developing world, the transatlantic divide in immigrant experiences is bound to grow. Fertility rates in Mexico, which a generation ago ran more than twice the level in the United States, now equal those on this side of the border. History shows that slowdowns in fertility precede slowdowns in emigration. Africa, a vastly more important source of migrants in Europe than in North America for simple reasons of geography, will be the last continent to witness the great decline in fertility rates historically associated with economic development.
A. (laughs) Very different. It was like: "That's going to blow up, so wait around for four hours while we set up the shot." I ended up reading a lot while I was waiting for them to set up shots. And I watched a lot of kung fu movies. Sam Jackson is really into them, and he gave me some to watch.
PNC further alleges that Gannon has not adequately cared for the apartments, as required under its loan terms.

It was during those four days that disaster struck. Her younger brother Joshua, 19, was hit and killed by a drunk driver. She was devastated. Although her voice shakes when she talks about him, she is determined to tell her brother's story, and the story of the community environment that made it possible. Tentatively titled "The Men We Reaped," it is a memoir that turns on the deaths of five young black men in DeLisle, and will be her next book.

The artwork comes in several sizes; some of it is commandingly large, while other pieces are smaller and more manageable. Pawlowska paints on wood, using paint that is thickly layered and spread in intense, vivid shades: rich blue, "the color of the sky - the mystery of divine life"; deep red, "the symbol of life"; and gold, which, she says in her written notes, is "not regarded as a color," but as "the divine light."
Speaking on condition of anonymity, military officials said it was believed that the assailant had suffered a mental breakdown. But among Afghans, psychiatric disorders are rarely spoken of, and mental illness is not generally considered a mitigating factor in a violent crime.

Strongsville's request for a tax renewal appeared headed for defeat. After requests for new taxes were rejected in May and August, the district decided to go for renewal of an expiring tax.

The Zambrano saga already has enough chapters to fill a book, which would then be made into a Quentin Tarantino movie. He tried the patience of three managers, all of whom defended his boorish behavior at first, only to get kicked in the gut by his lack of respect for authority. The general manager who handed Zambrano a $91.5 million contract didn't even get a phone call when he decided to "retire" after walking out on the team in Atlanta last August.
Writing for the court, Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor found that "a criminal sentence is final upon the issuance of a final order" and that Ohio lawmakers tied the hands of judges when they passed the so-called truth-in-sentencing law in 1996, which repealed the section of law that had allowed the leeway to modify sentences.

A witness to Surf City’s ordeal, Harvey Cedars took a different approach. It wanted a contiguous dune line, the only way it would be effective against a storm surge. What easements the borough couldn’t get through negotiations, it obtained through condemnation. Municipal officials offered oceanfront homeowners what they considered fair market value for the strips of sand: $300 apiece. Objecting to what they felt was not just compensation, homeowners went to court. This time they didn’t sue over loss of privacy but rather over what they said was the lost value of their property because the new dunes blocked their ocean views — the most valuable asset of their homes.

Whatever one thinks of Santorum's stances on social questions, it's clear what those stances are. That is, the arguments he makes will get a straight up-or-down Ohio vote on March 6 -- not the usual shades-of-gray, squishy "debate" that accommodating moderates prefer.

One-third of the suicides at Fort Campbell involved soldiers who, like Jeremy Campbell, had never served overseas, much less in a war zone. Soldiers with one or no deployments represent 70 percent of all military suicides, with 60 percent occurring during a soldier's first enlistment.
I'm calling about Opinion Shaper Jeanie Ransom's column on cell phone use. I thought this article was very ridiculous and in bad taste. To bring up these accidents in the past was a very terrible thing to do. As a matter of fact, the bus accident on Interstate 44, the truck was actually not slowing but was stopped in a construction area when the bus hit it. Also, she said school bus drivers can use cell phones. School bus drivers cannot use cell phones in the district that I drive in. If we get caught using a cell phone, we get fired. If we get a phone call, what we can do is pull over to the side, take the call and then be on about our routes.
Ron Throupe, professor of Real Estate at the Burns School of Real Estate and Construction Management at the University of Denver, said rents tend to moderate during the first quarter, but in 2012, the "rent rose to an all-time high instead."
It's a response to cases in which students have been punished for bringing fake guns or butter knives to school and doesn't address sexual harassment policies. However, Sen.

The challenge for teams like Ohio State, Michigan State and Wisconsin, three of the best defensive teams in the country, is to continue to lock down on that end of the court while hoping for some more breathing room offensively. That should especially be true for big men such as Indiana's Cody Zeller, Michigan State's Adreian Payne and Derrick Nix and Ohio State's Jared Sullinger.

Not even Tim Tebow can clean up Meyer's fraudulent image anymore. Remember when Meyer came to Florida and preached discipline and bragged about how he only recruited players whose character ranked in "the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent." He then went on to compile one of the most embarrassing arrest records in college football.
But Democrats -- with legal clearance from the Republican-run state Supreme Court -- are launching a referendum drive to put the September map (Substitute House Bill 319) up for a statewide vote. And because of how Ohio's referendum procedure works, that vote couldn't be held until November 2012.

I'm confident we'll have her back."
Earlier Friday, thousands of demonstrators massed in Cairo's downtown Tahrir Square, including the powerful Muslim Brotherhood, Salafis and leftist movements. They demanded the generals hand over power to civilians and warned of possible vote-rigging in the presidential vote, due to start May 23. In the afternoon, they marched to the Defense Ministry, several miles away across Cairo in the district of Abbasiyah.
The Jets have drafted a running back each year under Rex Ryan: Shonn Greene in 2009, Joe McKnight and John Conner in 2010 and Bilal Powell in 2011. But with veteran LaDainian Tomlinson not expected to be back, the Jets still have a need at the position. If Alabama’s Trent Richardson is still on the board at No. 16, the Jets would be lucky to ground and pound with him, but the talented back is not expected to last nearly that long. They could instead address the position in a later round (Utah State’s Robert Turbin and Michael Smith both visited Florham Park), adding another young runner to the mix as they see if McKnight and Powell can grow into larger roles.

It's the usual mix of remakes, retreads and rip-offs. There's also the obligatory lame-looking Jennifer Aniston vehicle and those four words that send film fans scurrying to the box office: "directed by Sylvester Stallone."
Sometimes a person's "mom food" isn't even one that mom made, just one that's associated with her. Gabrielle Hamilton's mom was a great, but "challenging" cook, says the chef-owner of Prune in New York's East Village. Weaned on the wartime cooking of her French parents, Madeline Hamilton regularly laid her table with "cheese that really stank and oozed and had mold," her daughter says, plus "oily stews, innards and offal."

Where was I? Oh, yes: the world's all-time coldest wind chill. That's what you're going to be feeling at this point in an Obama second term. If you like his contempt for judicial review, parliamentary scrutiny and representative democracy now, wait'll you see how "flexible" he'll get starting in January 2013. The CFPB appointment is not a small thing. Indeed, its new director, one Richard Cordray, embodies what's gone so disastrously wrong with American government: you'll have to be in compliance with him, but he doesn't have to be in compliance with anybody, whether the Senate or the Constitution. As I say somewhere in my recent book, you don't need a president-for-life if you've got a bureaucracy-for-life. More and more aspects of the citizen's daily existence are regulated by rules and officials both of which are ever more disconnected from any meaningful accountability to the people's representatives. As the president says, look for even more "flexibility" in a second term: more non-recess recess appointments, more executive orders, more bewildering innovations from the commissars of the hyper-regulatory state.

"I will point out that the chain-smoking Monet didn't begin the 'Nympheas' until he was in his 70s. It took 10 years. Then he died," Hockney says. "But it must have given him, the moment he saw this project, a very powerful force in him that kept him alive."

Yes, most of them retire there. Some have been retired with their rider, because they develop such a strong bond. And some of the horses are given to organizations that work with disabled people because these horses are so calm. When they don't retire to the farm, we make sure they have a good place to stay.

But I realized with astonishment that it had been 40 years since I had expressed a feeling so spontaneously to a black person -- so pervasive and encompassing and overwhelming is the race-consciousness our society. Los Angeles and Simi Valley demonstrated how adept we have become, we whites, in shutting out our recognition of the essential humanity of all peoples, in consigning those of other races to their own worlds and living within our own.
"I think transparency would cure a lot of our problems in health care," Stouffer said. "It's amazing what the light of day cleans up."
Ward 3 Councilman Ronald Ely contradicted Matyja on a number of points.

Moreover, Ely stressed, "the bonds will stop if the development does not meet Wickliffe City Code."

Like glasses or orthodontics, "whatever it is, you fix it," Tammy says. Even if it is more complicated than eye charts, or braces, which Max has needed, twice. She is nervous about Max's surgery, because there are risks with any surgery. But she knows that if he should ever change his mind -- though she doesn't think he will -- it is reversible. And the only other path -- forcing Max to continue being a brutally unhappy Makenzie -- wasn't an option at all.

Interestingly, we haven't heard much attack on Mr. Zimmerman's right to own or carry a gun under Florida law. What is at issue (aside from the potential racism involved in the death of an unarmed 17-year-old African-American in a hoodie and the initial failure of authorities to fully investigate or file charges in the incident) is whether state law should be set up in such a way as to encourage an individual to seek confrontation in a shoot-first, ask questions later manner.
Who cares, that is beyond those who own him, train him and ride him and, most of all, bet him.

I suggest the "thumpers" check more the "literal Bible" they profess to know so much about. At times, the early church at Rome may have presumed things about "their" God that were not that helpful, perhaps believing they had superior knowledge of the creator than those of other places. St. Paul had to call them to task as he wrote in his letter to them "Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways. For who has known the mind of the Lord?"

The music is only a small part of it, he says. Most of the time, it's one on one  maybe just talking to them, reading the Bible with them, or just being there.
The trip appears to be part of the Democratic administration's strategy of highlighting successes of its controversial economic decisions. Obama is going to the Chrysler plant "to help again underscore and help people understand the amount of restructuring that happened," Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Politico today. The decisions made and " what management has brought to those companies should make Americans feel more confident in the underlying strength of the American worker, of the quality of American innovation, and what you can do as an American company," Geithner said.

-- "Real Housewives of New York" star Jill Zarin wrote on her blog that Teresa shouldn't overindulge her kids, and Andy asks Teresa what she thinks of that: "When I was growing up too, my dad, anything I ever wanted he gave me, and I turned out great. I think I'm fabulous."
At the engagement party the complications begin in earnest, with the filmmakers throwing everything conceivable, literally and figuratively, in their way. The hurdles designed to test their relationship (and our patience) also provide all the subplots and ancillary roles for this sprawling cast. The two most significant snags come from near — courtesy of Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) and Violet's sister Suzie (Alison Brie); and far — a University of Michigan teaching fellowship, with Ann Arbor about as far as they could get from a San Francisco state of mind.
Sandusky has been charged with molesting eight boys over 15 years, with some of the abuse taking place at the Penn State football complex. Paterno knew of the allegations in 2002 and told his supervisor, but he didn't do enough to stop his old friend. Penn State failed miserably, all around.
Comedy of manners turns into full-blown farce at the hands of Yasmina Reza in "God of Carnage." That's a bit disappointing after savoring the French playwright's lighter and more piercing touch in plays like "Art" and "The Unexpected Man." But it can be very funny in the no-holds-barred version now at San Jose Repertory Theatre.
The state Department of Education says it believes Auburn is the first school district in Maine that will give iPads to kindergartners. The school board last week unanimously approved the plan to give all kindergartners iPads next fall.
Environmentalists aren't happy.

Upon arriving there, they encounter Sven (Hank Azaria), a most-unusual penguin in that he can fly. This captivates all of the other penguins, who treat him as some sort of mystical character. Certainly Erik is captivated and takes Sven's mantra -- if you want it, you must will it, and if you will it, it will be yours -- to heart.

2007 Chateau Ste. Michelle "Eroica" Riesling by Dr. Loosen, Columbia Valley, Wash., 12 percent alcohol ($11-$14): Rieslings are great because of their high levels of tartness and slight residual sweetness.

I'm wondering what other people see in the city of Maplewood that they were able attract the BMW dealership there where the junk yard used to be, and now they're tearing all the homes and apartments down for the new Mini Cooper store. But yet they don't do anything about their eyesore buildings. The old Maplewood antique mall at Southwest and Manchester. They had a portion of the bricks fall down onto the sidewalk. Or the Stanfield apartment building at Lyndover and Bellevue. Neither one of those buildings has been painted for years. They're deteriorating, they're crooked, there's so much rotting wood. I just scratch my head. These people must not be doing their homework and looking around Maplewood as much as the rest of us do.

They left the big cheese and his front-office executives sitting in folding chairs on the third floor of the stadium. Paulson headed to his seat before kick, but on the way, said: "I'll tell you what, when those (expletive) come to our place they're going to be sitting in the stands."
Now we are trying to grow our utilities too big. When Exelon gobbles up Constellation Energy and Baltimore Gas and Electric Co., who will lose? Baltimore will lose, big time. When Exelon decides to cut back departments and workers, where do you suppose those people will be cut? From Baltimore of course. Exelon is a Chicago company. Baltimore will naturally be the first place to cut. Cut jobs. Cut services. Cut power supplies. But don't look for them to cut any executive salaries; in fact the Exelon CEO is set to receive a $21 million dollar bonus when BGE becomes another Exelon satellite.
The team of seniors has given up afternoons and Saturdays and time that could be spent doing just about anything but studying. But this group of eight has become hooked.

People close to the Edwardses, speaking privately, say they have been torn about whom to support. The former North Carolina senator is concerned that Obama may not be ready for the presidency and that his health care plan is inferior. But Edwards was highly critical of Clinton -- her policies, her ties to special interests and her character -- during his campaign, making it more difficult to support her now.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. - A federal trial involving nine defendants accused of conspiring in a child sex trafficking ring involving Somali gangs is wrapping up in Nashville earlier than expected.

Freedom from want and fear cannot be provided without infringing on others' rights. They cannot be paid for without taking wealth from some to spend on others. When government does such stuff, it doesn't ask for volunteers. It coerces.

"It's kind of like having a worn out motor in your car," he said. "Do you wait until it breaks or do you replace it when you think it's going to break? I know the propulsion system is getting pretty tired and we're trying to be proactive."
3. Kudos to the Cardinals for making the quick decision to retire Tony La Russa's No. 10. Great manager, historically prominent manager, an obvious move. One thing that intrigues me though: I think that Billy Southworth has to be one of the most (if not the most) overlooked figures in Cardinals history. He managed the Cardinals for 6+ seasons. He went 620-346 for an astounding winning percentage of .642. The Cardinals won the World Series in 1942 and 1944 with Southworth as manager, and the 1943 team won 105 games and the NL pennant. No, Southworth's career as manager was relatively short, but he led an amazing run for the franchise. In a pleasant surprise, the Veterans Committee honored Southworth by voting him into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. I believe the Cardinals should do more to recognize Southworth's prominent role in one of the most illustrious eras in franchise history.
Cleveland heard its own, too. Pere Ubu, the Pagans, the Dead Boys and the Electric Eels, from the Euclid Beach Band and Beau Coup to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.

When you put it that way, it sounds as if Congress can do practically anything that isn't explicitly forbidden someplace else in the Constitution. When limits are there, once you get past all that "Congress shall make no law . . ." stuff in the Bill of Rights?
In a budget approved by the council last spring, the mayor directed the city to finance a $15 million center through bonds over 10 years.

Danielle Jokela, 32, who lives in Rogers Park, testified that having the option to clear away student debt in bankruptcy would give borrowers a chip to negotiate with lenders. Currently, she said, there is no incentive for lenders to work with financially strapped borrowers.
It was late winter 1959, and the place was Fort Richardson, Alaska. I had just turned 3 whole years old and was convinced I'd found my calling. Chucky Yarborough: Trashman Extraordinaire! There was something about the soldiers hanging on the back of the trucks rumbling through the post picking up garbage that just oozed cool to me.
Making sure the kids get enough exercise in the summer months can be a challenge ("enough" being the amount it takes to tire them out so they don't have the energy to drive me crazy). During the school year they have gym and playtime with their classmates to tucker them out, and a trip down to the park can always take that extra edge off. But in the summer, parents have to find new ways to run the rug rats ragged because much like a bored golden retriever chewing up the entire house when left alone, if you don't exercise them, they will destroy everything and everyone you hold dear.
Monday, the office’s first day of business, the doctors, hygienists and office personnel welcomed Loan Township Mayor Frank Minor and Gloucester County Freeholder Heather Simmons, as well as many guests, to a ribbon cutting ceremony to celebrate the new location and the growth of jobs and the economy in the township.

That night, I watched LeBron be LeBron in Detroit. Late in the third quarter, he did what I didn't think was possible in a real game: go basket-to-basket in four dribbles. When I first reviewed the tape, I thought my eyes were lying to me. I kept replaying it. Four, four, four. Absolutely amazing. And I truly don't think he walked.

Last fall Sotheby's and Christie's International auctions for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art did well, a major improvement over comparable May auctions, although not as well as fall 2008. That seemed to indicate that though things are improving, they won't soon be returning to the dizzying heights of the art market boom, partly fueled by newly minted millionaires from places like Russia and China.
Sure, that first goal was a gift Sharks from the Sharks. Vladimir Sobotka's blast off the left wing bled through Sharks goaltender Antti Niemi. Vlasic tried to clear the puck as it rolled toward the empty net, but he whacked it in instead. But the crisp outlet pass by Kris Russell made the early goal (1 minute, 31 seconds into the game) possible.

The editor was excused from jury service after he was questioned by U.S. District Judge James Zagel, but Zagel has yet to rule on whether the Children's Memorial employee could serve.
While Baltimoreans are expected to pay the cost of the D.C. suburbs' public works projects, it's also worth noting that Montgomery County enjoys access to 11 Washington Metro stations — the same as the total number of metro stations in the entire city of Baltimore. However, unlike Baltimore's metro users, Montgomery County's have access to an entire Metro system with many destinations throughout the D.C. area. Montgomery County also boasts seven MARC stations, compared to Baltimore City's three. These transit stations give Montgomery County residents options to avoid tolls, something many commuting into Baltimore City do not have.

In 2008, the rapper pleaded guilty to federal weapons charges and serve time in prison, but was arrested on drug charges and sent back for an additional 11 months. On Wednesday, he was released a month early to serve out his time at the halfway house.
“I’ve rarely heard veterans use the word ‘hero,’ and never in relation to themselves. Veterans don’t really talk about their combat experiences much — they talk about it with each other, or perhaps during therapy, but it’s not something they often speak of. And in a way I wish they would.”
Written by Frenchman Pierre Nessmann, "The Gardener's Palette: A Year of Color in the Flower Garden" demystifies the somewhat daunting task of conceiving and planning a beautiful flower garden.
Whitman said non-member gyms do not have to follow the Member Club Standard of Care Agreement, which is intended to promote a safe environment for athletes. Member clubs are not allowed to employ banned members or allow them to work as volunteers. Whitman said this is important because some banned coaches do not have a criminal conviction and can therefore pass a simple background check.
Members of an Ohio-based fugitive task force bird-dogged their suspect. Tips poured in after the case was featured on the TV show "America's Most Wanted," and they found their fugitive's tracks in New York, Florida, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Mexico and elsewhere.

Williams might be leaning to joining Dallas, and play in his hometown – with or without Howard at his side. Maybe, though, the only thing stopping Williams from forcing his way to Orlando via a trade is Howard.

Or is it? Maybe there were good reasons a council majority chose to reshape the district as they did — since they clearly had to reshape in some fashion. Denver has grown a great deal over the past decade, with most of that growth occurring in the far northeast. As a result, the district that straddles the northeast finds itself by far the largest in population, and needing to shed nearly 30,000 people to get back to the proper size. That triggers a domino effect on district boundaries across the northern half of the city.

It really is no more complex than that, he insisted.
In the French drama "Elles," Juliette Binoche plays a multitasking magazine reporter whose mind and marriage are opened wide by a pair of part-time call girls.

However, Judge Bolton's decision may stand if the Supreme Court follows its precedents on immigration, which have held that immigration law rests entirely with the federal government. Her opinion relied heavily on a 1941 ruling in which the justices struck down a Pennsylvania law that required aliens to carry an identification card. She quoted Justice Hugo Black's comment that such a state identification system would infringe "the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens" and subject them to threat of "police surveillance."

The city-owned H.L. Mencken House suffers from more than 15 years of benign neglect. While unoccupied and unwatched, termites attacked the under flooring on the main level. This destruction has been abated. Additionally, the air-conditioning units malfunctioned, causing severe water damage to the interior walls and buckling to the hardwood floors.

A. Pumpkins are fun to grow for more than jack-o-lanterns. Your email went on to note you are baking them as a vegetable but they would likely make some great pies too. The seeds are kind of sticky, so remove them from the center of the pumpkins and wash them off a little. Then place them on wax paper or aluminum foil to dry indoors out of the sun. After drying for a day or two place them in a jar or plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator.

His specialties include a stellar sformato, a dense souffle made with lobster and ground polenta when I visited; perfectly done arancini (risotto balls); and halibut cheeks with polenta and jalapeno-mint marinara.

It was a calculated gamble for both sides. By offering a one-year deal, the Blazers could lose Oden to free agency after this season. But at the same time, they limited their losses should Oden become injured again.

But he also left himself at risk should he become injured again.

A: I started to understand that I was working very intimately and really wanted to expand the conversation, so it was just a kind of distancing, developing a macro view to get outside the micro.

After leaving the end papers I became more interested in color, but again it was found color, billboard paper taken from the street. I would cut it and color-separate the yellows, the blues and so on. It was very labor intensive.

Not only were too few students attempting the so-called A through G curriculum — a required series of high school English, math, social studies and other courses required for entry to California's public four-year colleges and universities — but the numbers attempting it were much lower among disadvantaged black and Latino students. Before the policy was adopted, many school administrators assumed these students were incapable of or uninterested in a future in college and steered them toward a less rigorous course of study.
Serge (Ron Himes), a wealthy dermatologist, has just spent a small fortune on a modern painting: a huge white rectangle. The piece offends Marc (Tim Schall), who considers it the emperor's new painting. The third friend, Yvan (Robert A. Mitchell), is too wrapped up in his own problems - which are legion, mostly involving his upcoming marriage - to care one way or the other. He just wants everyone to get along and give him a break from the demanding women in his life.
Perhaps what Watkins-Murphy sought to address doesn’t quite rise to what Burke may have conjured when he considered “the triumph of evil,” but the lesson remains. When something isn’t right, the best and bravest thing to do is to stand up, tell the truth and be counted.
"We've been struggling away with this gallery for nearly two years now," says Sanday at another bas-relief, one depicting a figure believed to be Jayavarman VII leading his troops into battle.

A senior BP executive, Lamar McKay, cautioned, "It's inappropriate to draw any conclusions before all the facts are known." But the documents established the firmest evidence to date of the sequence of catastrophic events that led to the explosion and worsening spill, a series of failures more reminiscent of the loss of the space shuttle Challenger than the wreck of the Exxon Valdez.

"If you're a female at this age, it's not very acceptable to be competitive," James said. "For many, many years I didn't think I was a competitive person — not just in running, but in anything. Then one day I said to myself: 'You know, I am competitive. It's probably just with myself, but yeah, I am competitive.' "
Hey, Shawn: Dunleavy, who makes $10.6 million this season, will be a free agent next summer. As he showed against the Cavs, he can shoot, and he is a smart player. He also has missed a lot of games the past couple of seasons with injuries, and the knocks against him are that he's slow and soft. That being said, if he stays healthy this season, he will attract attention next summer because of his shooting, and the Cavs could take a look.

Who would have thought that the DFL Party could be so misunderstood? Today I had a message from our credit card company to call immediately about possible fraud. I feared that someone had used our card to run up horrific charges.
The Predators have their sights set on building on what they accomplished last season, when they won the first playoff series in franchise history. That was a cause of celebration in Nashville, because they had to start somewhere. Winning one series means little to the Wings, because they've set the bar very high after winning four Stanley Cups since 1997, the last one in 2008, three seasons after the salary cap was instituted.
Dixon Doll, founder of Doll Capital Management, said his "back of the envelope" estimate is that valley venture capitalists may have stakes in as many as 100 companies strong enough to consider IPOs. He said he is doubtful, however, that 2010 will come remotely close to the performance of 2007, when 86 venture-backed companies nationwide went public.
Beattie was a demanding coach who knew Americans in that era had no chance of beating Europeans unless they were stronger and tougher. He drove them relentlessly through offseason training sessions in Boulder. They cursed him then. They love him now.
"I still feel it," Smith said, after he scored 18 points that couldn't have been predicted unless you spied on the shootaround. If you had been there, you would have hoped it implied an even bigger evening than the 15 he scored on Cincinnati in the East semifinals Thursday.

Here is why Wandry matters. Our current system imposes a gift tax of up to 35% when taxpayers give assets away, with exceptions. Individuals now get one $5.12 million lifetime exemption, and they can also give up to $13,000 of assets a year to an unlimited number of recipients. (Next year the lifetime break is scheduled to drop to $1 million and the top rate to rise to 55%.)

"AMD, our prime competitor, is in there well under our pricing and selling at a $20 kit pricing there. We still win the lion's share of that market.

Norris' jazz riff on themes within pioneering 1959 drama "A Raisin in the Sun" requires no prior familiarity with Lorraine Hansberry's classic (although Center Theater Group has made that easier to obtain by simultaneously presenting the splendid Ebony Rep revival on Culver City's sister Kirk Douglas stage). If you don't recall the struggle of the Younger family to escape Chicago's inner city for a house in an all-white suburb, Norris has already firmly woven the passion underlying their dreams of ownership and identity into his own dramatic fabric.
"It's hitting the fan in my district, and people are extremely upset because of the spiking of their bills," said City Councilwoman Mary Pat Clarke, who has been calling for reform of the Bureau of Water and Wastewater. "We were contacted by 200 people from Ednor Gardens-Lakeside last month alone."

The NASCAR Racing Experience comes this year to the Myrtle Beach Speedway just across the Intracoastal Waterway from downtown. Also opening next month, it will make it easier to get behind the wheel of a car that was once driven by a NASCAR driver like Jimmie Johnson or Jeff Gordon.
All that notwithstanding, it is a strange time in history for self-appointed advocates for women to feel oppressed on their behalf. They must have missed the growing literature on "The End of Men" and similar themes. Women earn about 60 percent of bachelor's and master's degrees, and are reaching parity with men in medical and law schools. Their attitudes to work are changing. In a historic reversal, more young women ages 18 to 34 (66 percent) than young men (59 percent) say high-paying work is one of the most important things or very important, according to a new Pew survey.
"Missouri, along with Illinois and the rest of the nation, benefits greatly from Mark Kirk's leadership," Blunt said.

Albergo has cooked at several New Jersey restaurants, including Osteria Dante in Red Bank and Church Street in Montclair. Rather than learning his art in culinary school, he was, in effect, home-schooled. Starting at age 5, he began working at the side of his Grandma Rose, creating a foundation on which he would build throughout his life. Everything she prepared was from scratch and done right. The restaurant named after her reflects that philosophy.
"He ran the equipment that unloaded coal barges and operated the conveyor belts," said a former co-worker, Melvin Bull of White Marsh.

He also loved his fishing and was a funny guy, who told great stories. He was strong as an ox."
To prevent a possible conflict of interest, the case was moved out of Morris County to the Stanhope Municipal Court in Sussex County, where Wade was found not guilty of the charge after a trial.
The lending gains are being driven in part by a retreat by European lenders tied to the region's debt crisis. As banks on the continent sell assets to raise capital and reduce their dependence on scarce dollar funding, big U.S. lenders are stepping in. Mr. Dimon said on Friday that "a little bit" of the bank's lending increase can be attributed to a pullback in lending by hobbled European competitors.
NFLdraftscout.com writes, "While Claiborne came to Baton Rouge as a receiver, he's leaving as a lockdown cornerback worthy of a top-10 pick. There is no finesse in his game and his physical tools -- height, long arms, natural flexibility and lateral movement -- plus bump-and-run experience will expedite his ascension to Pro Bowl-level starter as his body matures."

For example, start with the tortilla "sandwich" called a calzetta ($6.50). It's stuffed with potatoes, frisee and goat cheese and, when dipped into a lively chipotle-enhanced sour cream, is delish. Move onto a bowl of corpulent mussels ($10.50) brimming with spiky chile-garlic broth. Or, perhaps, go for the sassy green pepper sauce that riff on a crispy deep-fried Rock Shrimp ($12).

With all of the horses seemingly healthy -- and you know how quickly that can change -- the focus here will be on the style of the race. Trinniberg, as I wrote in my story on the draw, is the wild card. Having never raced more than seven furlongs, his connections nevertheless feel convinced that their horse will win the race. Does such wild-eyed confidence mean they're prepared to let him dash from the gates and see how far he'll go? Top trainers such as Bob Baffert and Graham Motion deferred when asked yesterday how they thought the race might unfurl, saying that it would be up to the jockeys.
The Shaker Heights visit was Obama's 16th to Ohio since taking office in January 2009. While the event was billed as an official presidential visit to discuss the economy, there was some political calculus to the timing of his swing-state appearance.

It's a region begging for a new concert of nations that accommodates conservative monarchies and new republics.

He is describing here the death of little Nell, and one pleasure of this volume is to track his "set of characters" — Sam Weller and Oliver Twist and Pip and Martin Chuzzlewit and Mrs. Micawber and the rest — as they fire his imagination, then fade into cold print.

He writes with reference to prison reform, the pleasures of a nighttime stroll and the travails of his journeys to America and Italy; he writes devastatingly of the failed poetic efforts of a man who sent him amateur verse: "lock up your papers, burn your pen, and thank Heaven you are not obliged to live by it."

"So I want to be sure that you're telling us that the attorney general and the Department of Justice do recognize the authority of the federal courts through unelected judges to strike acts of Congress or portions thereof in appropriate cases."
As a young lawyer, Krenzler ran the successful statewide campaigns of C. William O'Neill, first for three terms as attorney general in the early 1950s, followed by two terms as Ohio governor later that decade. Krenzler was rewarded with a position as O'Neill's right-hand man in the Cleveland area.

Houston had a mid-round rookie playing quarterback (T.J. Yates) because its top two QBs (Matt Schaub, second round; Matt Leinart, first round) were injured.
Huge Tree's green onion pastry, a little sesame-studded morsel of golden flaky pastry, is halfway between an onion scallion pancake and a croissant. Take a bite and admire the way it spans the gentle, crumbling crisp of the outer shell, to the soft semi-stretchy flakes below, to the near melting moistness of the inner layers. You can also get the same dough stuffed with pleasantly bland shredded daikon or charmingly sweet curried pork, or just sweetened and hollow.

There are other mythic themes in the paintings such as Narcissus, the beautiful youth who fell in love with his reflected image; Gala, portrayed as creator-destroyer or saint-seductress. I would have wished for more pointed explanations in the exhibition's wall labels. Often, those texts are distractions that inhibit our own discoveries about art but in this case, with the myriad ideas working through the paintings, specific references to mythological examples would have been helpful.

Not long ago Scott was able to change units almost the way hockey coaches do lines and defensive pairings. Not with the injuries, though. And, I think it's starting to have an impact on their brutal second quarters. The Cavs are dead last in second-quarter scoring with 20.3 points per game. Any wonder why they are needing big fourth-quarter comebacks?
Kucinich's office says the school's past speakers have included former President Bill Clinton and former secretaries of state Colin Powell, James Baker, and Madeleine Albringht.
"I think we're madder about losing this one than as excited as we were about winning Game 1 because we felt like we came out with the right mentality," All-Star guard Chris Paul said. "We hit first and stuff like that. But it just didn't work in our favor."
Waner, the 2004 and 2005 Miss Colorado player of the year for ThunderRidge in Highlands Ranch, went on to star at Duke and USA Basketball before beginning sports broadcasting and youth coaching careers.

McCain is the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which hasn't brought its final version of the fiscal 2012 defense authorization bill to the Senate floor.

"Farther Away" offers a series of takes on the actual life, as filtered through Franzen's abiding obsessions: literature, birding and (yes) himself. I'm tempted to add Wallace to that list, since the book, or part of it anyway, exists in both his real and metaphorical shadow; among his most widely read essays is an earlier Kenyon commencement address. But if, at times, Franzen himself seems to want to frame the collection as his side of an ongoing discussion with his dead friend about art and life and the necessity of engagement - "I understood," he writes at one point, "the difference between his unmanageable misery and my manageable discontents to be that I could escape myself in the joy of birds and he could not" - that is, ultimately, too reductive a lens.
Mr. Fitch, and other police chiefs, though, should continue asking citizens and taxpayers what they think. Red-light cameras would be an interesting topic, as would funding for police departments and ways for the county and its too many municipalities to cooperate.

Talk about a fun wine: Its color made me think of the cherry Lifesavers I loved as a kid. But don't be misled by the hue. Although it tastes of cherries and strawberries, this is not a sweet wine. It's dry - but not bone dry - and it has a refreshing citrusy finish that's great for the summer. It also has a bit more body than some rosés, making it a nice option for red wine lovers seeking a chilled wine for al fresco dining on a warm afternoon.

The same goes for Chauncey, who will be snatched up immediately. We asked Stoudemire how Billups felt about being discarded like last week’s stale bread, and Amar’e replied, “Chauncey’s a veteran player, he understands the business of basketball. So it doesn’t bother him at all.”

Overall, it's fair to say the Orthodox Church has flown below the radar in American culture since it first came to North America in the eighteenth century through Russian missionary settlements in Alaska and via droves of immigrants from Eastern Mediterranean and East European countries beginning in the late nineteenth century. Indeed, it is often through ethnic events - whether Greek, Romanian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Russian, or Arab – that people first become acquainted with the Orthodox Church. So it's not unusual that encounters with the Orthodox begin through one's appetite for baklava or pirogy, or perhaps while attending a friend's "Big Fat Greek Wedding".
TBI can worsen the symptoms of people who already have PTSD or who go on to develop it because of, say, a near-fatal bomb explosion. Curiously, however, PTSD appears to be more severe in soldiers who suffer mild head injuries rather than severe ones. The reason may be that prolonged unconsciousness can blot out the memory of the traumatic event.
back LaMichael James, quarterback Darron Thomas, wide receiver Lavasier Tuinei and tight end David Paulson are headed to the NFL. A quarterback competition is underway between Bryan Bennett and Marcus Mariota. Kenjon Barner is expected to be the lead back. Several receivers are vying for increased minutes.

Hey, Hoynsie: On paper it seems Justin Masterson has become the clear-cut ace of the pitching staff. Do you find that to be the case? Does this alarm you? -- Tim Umpleby, Toronto, Ohio
We’ve seen a number of cases with Google employees who were using this where they’ve discovered things they had no idea was going on, but turned out to be major problems with their houses. One person who was lucky enough to have a pool in her back yard discovered her pool pump had been on 24 hours a day for, probably, the past several years and costing her several thousand dollars. You compare your house to others with similar demographics and you find things that are way out of whack.

NBC EMPLOYEES have some mandatory summer reading ahead of them that won't be anywhere near as pulse-pounding as "Fifty Shades of Grey." A network insider tells us that in an eye-raising instance of life-imitating-"30 Rock," a low-level staffer at the Comcast-owned network went around handing out copies of "An Incredible Dream: Ralph Roberts and the Story of Comcast." The 424-page doorstop of a book was written by William Novak and reportedly commissioned by Comcast, which may have something to do with why the book is not available on Amazon.

You might not like him right now because he refuses to tell you what you want to hear. No comforting words are coming out of his mouth. I, on the other hand, prefer his silence to the feel-good lies that I have heard from too many other pro sports moguls who would rather play the disingenuous PR spin game in public, then do all sorts of mischief behind your back.
NEW YORK — Director-choreographer Susan Stroman is standing with arms folded, watching a group of dancers run through a number. They have the great athleticism and some serious lung power, all of which is way too big for the rehearsal room. But it won't feel that way once they're onstage.

Kevin had a doctor's appointment last week. He's been a patient of Rodde Cox since 2005, so they know each other pretty well. Usually, the medical stuff is dispatched fairly quickly, then the discussion gets into some friendly banter. The appointment is usually the last one of the day, so after the medical treatment, the time is spent "swatting flies and telling lies."
They have lost five games they led in the seventh inning. General Manager Jerry Dipoto is actively searching for relief help — “looking under every rock,” he said recently — but his most costly decision might have been during the offseason when he opted not to sign an experienced closer to replace Walden and move the hard-throwing right-hander into an apprentice role in the bullpen.

When the InterContinental Hotel brand took over the 18th-century mansion Porto Palacio das Cardosas, preserving the landmark's baroque façade, it punctuated the city center's rise. With a flourish.

The complex encompasses a wellness center, formal greenhouse restaurant, cafe Astoria (the better culinary choice), and suitably neo-baroque guestrooms, each a swirl of damask, silver-leafed desks, padded leather headboards, marble bathrooms and jewel-toned wing chairs.

Most driveway experts will back you up on at least one point – that sealing every year is excessive. Even many sealing professionals and seal-coat manufacturers agree on that point. Sealing every year can actually lead to problems, including seal-coat peeling and cracking. However, letting your driveway go unsealed for five years might also be excessive, especially if it has turned gray and is developing small cracks. There is some controversy about how often an asphalt (blacktop) driveway should be sealed, but every three years appears to strike a good balance. When an asphalt driveway turns gray, it indicates oxidation of the asphalt and weathering by sun, rain and freezing. A coat of sealer should be helpful. The small cracks are another sign that the asphalt is having problems. If the cracks are larger than hairline, fill them with top-quality crack filler before sealing. Picking good crack fillers can also be difficult. In general, avoid cheap products – they won't last more than a year or so. Most dealers sell professional-grade fillers that cost more, but will usually last a lot longer. Very tiny (hairline) cracks can be filled by the sealer; many sealers contain sand-like filler material that will close them. Before sealing, clean the driveway as thoroughly as possible. Use a blower or scraper to remove all debris and dirt. Finally, whether you seal the driveway or hire a pro, make sure a top-quality sealer is used.

We probably have a couple thousand species over these three acres, and I oversee the entire collection. If I hear about a new plant - one that's newly discovered or brought into cultivation for the first time - that I think has potential for us, I'll try and track it down. There's a lot of experimentation involved when bringing new plants to the garden, and the key question is whether or not they'll succeed in our climate. There's a lot of trial and error in finding what works. I'm also in charge of hybridizing plants. I look for two plants that have complementary characteristics and combine them to make something new and possibly better in some way than the original two plants.

When I got here in 2000, I thought Miller was a mouthy punk who was going to be a pain-in-the-derriere to cover. Then we met. And I can say there are very few athletes who've ever impressed me more with their honesty, humility and professionalism.

That's why even if Senator Currie is found innocent he should be removed from office.

Get the lead out. If you buy anything old and painted, it probably has lead in it. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it, but you should take precautions before sanding or scraping paint from cabinets, doors, wood flooring and other items made before 1978, when the federal government banned lead paint in homes. Work on the piece outdoors, keep children out of the area, wear a respirator, gloves and goggles, and clean up with a HEPA vacuum. Too much trouble? Don't buy the piece.

* If the Cardinals (as expected) close on that long-term contract extension with Molina, the price will be high but it's a positive move for the team and the future. Molina is more than just an elite catcher. He's a big part of the Cardinals' spine. He's a big part of the team's collective competitive personality.

Smyly took advantage of the reprieve, settled down, and didn't give up another hit until the seventh inning -- a soft flare by Rodriguez. Leyland pulled Smyly at that point, but not because of shrinking velocity or control.

Which brings us back to Justice Ginsburg. She would have people believe that if the court rules the individual mandate unconstitutional, the conservative thing to do would be to preserve the rest of Obamacare.

When Bon Jovi received a nomination last year, detractors argued that the popular Jersey group lacked the artistic merit required for enshrinement. Supporters reminded us how few groups were still capable of filling stadiums — something Bon Jovi does with ease.

It is not a student's fault if he or she is being shuttled from one parent or grandparent to another, has no time or place to do homework or is never encouraged to read. But it is not the teacher's fault either. The very best teacher who can jump through hoops while tap dancing through a lesson will never inspire a child whose home does not value education.

But then Fry is better at pointing out the contradictions in his character than anyone else. Chief among these is the discrepancy between his unflappable public-school English manner and his jangling sense of himself as a "Jewish mongrel with an addictive self-destructive streak." A gay man who infamously outed himself as a celibate during his long sexless period, Fry, like Wilde, is a consummate inside-outsider—a societal position unmatched for comic surveillance.

Rating: TWO AND A HALF STARS NV Schramsberg Mirabelle North Coast Brut Rosé ($24) This may be a good transitional wine to Champagne, as one panelist noted.

But when Jean-Michel falls in love with the daughter of an anti-gay politician, her family must come to dinner to meet his own.

Mitchell says the charges are untrue and part of a political smear. The allegations had been the subject of anonymous e-mails and rumors for weeks.

With U.S. farmers planting the largest crop of corn in 75 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects the resulting harvest to reach new records. And that could mean cheaper food for consumers.

Globally, corn production will grow by 75 million tons, or 10 percent, to 946 million tons due to record crops in the United States, China, Brazil and Ukraine, according to the USDA.

"I don't think there are any guarantees in this situation, from what it sounds like," he said. "He really needs to come in and prove not only to the coaching staff, but to the players that he's really a changed guy- not only in spring training or that first month of the season, but he's got to carry that over through the rest of the season. That's the big thing. That's going to be a huge thing, trust-wise, for the players and the organization, to see if this is going to be a long term thing."
Biggest head-scratcher: Gino Gradkowski. In hindsight, it doesn’t appear the Ravens wanted Wisconsin center Peter Konz as much as we all thought that they did. They passed on him twice and didn’t move up to select him later in the second round. Instead, they selected their potential center of the future early in the fourth. The Ravens had Gradkowski, who played center and guard at Delaware, in for a pre-draft visit, but most of Baltimore let out a collective “Who?!?” when his name was called. This looked like a reach at first, but it has been reported that other teams also thought highly of Gradkowski.
A's fans know that when you stall the A's, you stall the efforts of general manager Billy Beane, whose cinematically celebrated genius is on sabbatical until further notice. That, as much as anything Wolff says or does, irritates fans in Oakland.

— CULTURE AND ARTS: Don't worry, the debt crisis isn't going to shut down the Louvre in Paris or the Vienna State Opera House. Culture will play a central role in European life for the foreseeable future. But how much of it should be financed by the government? That's a question being asked in many European capitals as budgets are being tightened. As part of its austerity drive, Spain's new conservative government has eliminated the Culture Ministry as a self-standing institution, merging it with education and sports. A program to subsidize Spanish cinema — which made a name for itself around the world with Oscar-winning directors such Pedro Almodovar — has been scrapped. In Sweden, the government has decided to gradually dismantle a subsidy program that provided lifelong income guarantees for artists seen as particularly important to Swedish culture.

I'm not so sure. Ultimately, large government checks can and will buy influence. Here's another concern: Many of these programs would require the government, for the first time, to decide who is a journalist.

Yes, a Security Council resolution could be useful if it helps smooth the rough transition out of tyranny — not only in post-Assad Syria, but across the Arab world. But Washington has now spent months getting us here — handing the lead to the Europeans, who promptly put the Gulf Arabs in front (albeit, some say, while still pulling the strings). And “here,” now that the Arab League has unsurprisingly proved no match for Assad’s butchery, is back at the Security Council.

Some of us -- OK, me -- still sold Masterson short last year. Not in predicting he'd have trouble repeating his delivery at his size for nine innings though that was part of it.

God bless Stacey King - I couldn't have made it through the season without him. He's the color commentator for Comcast SportsNet, with a litany of Harry Caray-esque exclamations - "get me the hot sauce" and "too strong, too fast, too good" and such - that keep the whole thing fun, with a nod to his straight man, Neil Funk, the play-by-play announcer.

Dr. Sidney Kennedy, a psychiatrist at the University of Toronto who is leading a project called the Canadian Depression Biomarker Network, said Redei's study was the first to use messenger molecules as biological signposts for depression.

Turns out, the U.S. Attorney's Office says, it was Tran. The boat's owner didn't want to pour any more money into the fake fishing voyage than absolutely necessary. So rather than top off the fuel tanks to make it look like a round trip was planned, he bought just enough gas for a short, one-way trip. And no matter how hard they tried, Tran’s henchmen could not sink that boat — buoyed by that fuel tank, an unsinkable balloon of air.

If he doesn't like the back seat, then he can be abstinent.

In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. Those days are over. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We will strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe-haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whose intentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan's democracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.

Whoever gets him is getting one heck of a talented athlete. He's fast. He makes cuts in full sprint and leaves guys embarrassed to even go home. He can turn screen passes into home runs. He's smart, likeable and just an all-around good kid, just like his buddy Clinton-Dix.

"Mercury is a neuro-toxin. There is no acceptable body level for lead or mercury," Aleguas said. "And with kids, particularly, it's an issue. They have growing brains."
* Why did the police decide to close the case "exceptionally," on their own, rather than consult with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, as they did in 2004, and ask prosecutors either to consider filing criminal charges against Vanecko or present the case to a grand jury to decide if charges were warranted?

"With this recommendation, we're nearing a watershed moment in our fight against HIV," Loduca said. "We know this isn't a magic bullet, and it's not going to be the right prevention strategy for everyone, but it could save thousands of lives in the United States and potentially millions around the world."
Factory activity weakened this spring, in part because of temporary factors. High gasoline prices forced consumers to spend less elsewhere, which cut demand for factory goods. And the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan led to supply-chain disruptions that slowed U.S. manufacturing production, particularly in the auto and computer industries.
In the meantime, Leonard, a former firefighter who oversees the Portland Fire Bureau, said he hopes to raise the $2.4 million by next January through mostly private donations. That would leave enough time to have the monument constructed by the yearly service in June 2011, he said.

Taxidermy is not quick work. If you kill an animal this year, you're not going to see the finished product until next November. Once a customer brings in his prized bloody hide, Snyder has to flesh and salt the animal, send it to a tannery, prep the skin and place it over a foam mannequin before he ever even begins the painstaking artistic process of sculpting an animal into a lifelike statue.

The phone also could ring this weekend for SDSU punter Brian Stahovich, though only two or three punters are expected to be drafted.

What's more, Polanski surprisingly gets less than stellar performances from his A-list cast. Reilly and Winslet, both character actors of immense range and depth, somehow fall flat here, while Foster goes so vein-poppingly over-the-top with uptight self-righteousness that it's hard to take her seriously. Only Waltz, playing a corporate attorney with all the moral slipperiness that job implies, inhabits his character in a way that is both convincing and compelling.
Last fall, after the Cardinals clinched their 11th World Series title, Oquendo was one of six candidates interviewed for the vacant manager's job and, according to all reports, he was impressive.

FDIC officials say they floated the idea among fellow regulators as far back as September. They believe the rules are the quickest way to reform the troubled industry, which has been the subject of numerous complaints.
Learning new words adds gray matter, as a matter of fact. (Your brain doesn't have to shrink with age.) And adults actually are better at learning new languages than kids, if you can put aside linguistic habits (the brain gets trained to ignore sounds that it doesn't need for comprehension) and embrace the nonsensical. That's how kids learn; they associate sounds with objects, then recognize sounds and words as labels, then link words with meaning. So to learn a new language, whether it's with a class or through audio tapes, remember these tips:
Gerry Lunn, curator of Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, said this city was in mourning for months after the disaster, with much of its downtown draped in black bunting.

Newhouse and Roghan had been in the area on a contract painting job, police said. It is unclear why they fled. The driver and passenger in the SUV were not charged.
Second: The only way to wirelessly share Photo Journals from iPhoto is by first uploading them to iCloud, which generates a unique Web link to that Photo Journal. This link can then be shared with others by email, but it's frustrating that Apple didn't directly integrate a way to share these creations via Facebook, Flickr, SmugMug or other photo sites. The emails generate terribly long URLs that look ugly in Facebook and don't include any thumbnail images. A spokeswoman said Apple would address this issue in a software update.
"We don't want them to stop the protest and the rallies, we just want to make sure that they remain peaceful," Fulton said. "We're going through the process the right way, the proper way. We just ask that everybody that supports us do the same thing. Even the ones who don't support us, we want to make sure that they protest in a peaceful manner."

The worst stench of all is the campaign's reliance on the so-called Huron report, which is nothing but a late-coming PowerPoint presentation based on a lot of guesswork about tax credits, possible changes in technology and possible changes in the cost of producing solar energy. It has no more credibility than a fortune teller looking into a crystal ball and saying you'll be rich someday. Maybe, maybe not.

Several of the great successes are the simplest dishes. Crispy seared chicken ($18) is perfectly prepared: the skin crackles and the breast is as moist and tender as the dark meat. The accompanying potato puree is buttery and delicious, while a side of greens supply a welcome, bitter-edged bite. Monday's well-known twice-cooked fries ($4) deserve their fame, as does the better-than-any-ketchup-in-the-world smoked tomato aioli served alongside.

The disorder is typically treated with anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, carbamazapine or valproate. Such drugs are effective in controlling seizures in perhaps as many as 60% of cases. But when the patient fails treatment with at least two different drugs, their epilepsy is said to be medically refractory and they are candidates for surgery. Such surgery removes the area of the brain that is misfiring and causing the seizures. Physicians typically insert electrodes into the brain to identify the source of the electrical disturbance, then remove a small amount of tissue that is involved. The most common type of procedure is called a lobectomy.

Such a notion explains Weschler's long interest in the visual arts. His first job after graduating from UC Santa Cruz's Cowell College in 1974 was at UCLA, where he worked as an editor on a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded oral history of the Los Angeles art scene. It was here that he first heard of Irwin, who was approaching what he would later call "Point Zero," the place of ultimate reduction in which he sought to eradicate the distinction between art and the outside world. If this sounds abstract, it is, but it's also highly concrete -- the kind of apparent contradiction on which Weschler thrives.
Why? Maybe he doesn't feel any different -- normal with "silent" conditions like high blood pressure. Or maybe taking pills makes him feel old and sick, when he sees himself as young and strong. Or maybe he thinks the BP reading was wrong. Or he doesn't believe it's as bad as the doc says. (It is.) Or he's afraid of side effects. Or he's just suspicious of prescription drugs -- some people are.

“Europe is going to stay on the front page,” Philip Orlando, the New York-based chief equity strategist at Federated Investors Inc., which oversees about $370 billion, said in a phone interview. “There’s potential headline risk there,” he said. “The U.S. jobless claims are good. This gives us the read-through that May’s jobs numbers are likely going to be better. Yet tomorrow’s report will still be consistent with this temporary soft patch.”
“I think the whole idea of these PACs becoming larger than the campaigns themselves is a very bad idea,” he said. “I just don’t like the way the law is, but we certainly follow the law as it exists to make sure that we’re not at a disadvantage in getting our message out.”

Yes, the Yankees are ruthless; yes, as Rich suggests, "There are only three possible outcomes to a Yankees season: embarrassment (2004), disappointment (2005-08, 2010), and satisfaction (2009)." And yet, peer beneath the surface, and you'll discover something unexpected, that the truest Yankees fans, the "fans of long standing," are "obsessive, passionate, and most astonishing to me, they live in constant fear. No matter how much success their team has, they still expect the worst."
And remember, I’m only talking about scripted, feature films here. I’m not even going to go into all the surreality-TV shows that picture us as a state full of violent, orange-skinned thugs with petroleum-slicked hairdos and painfully inflated chests. (And those are just the women.)

"What a strange weekend, and it's going to get stranger (today)," Ryan Hunter-Reay said.
Billy’s sudden and passionate embrace of the deaf community drives a wedge between him and his boisterous, bohemian family. His mother, Beth (Mare Winningham), and sister, Ruth (Gayle Rankin), cope well enough. His tormented brother, Daniel (Will Brill), does not — “I always thought the signing persona was a bit Jewish,” he sniffs, among other jibes — and skids into a self-destructive spin.

For the rest of his career, Rothko would refine these "color-field" works, arguing over their philosophy and formal technique with fellow practitioners Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still. The dominant interpretation of these works, including two of the Portland show's best pieces, untitled works from 1963 and 1969 featuring dark, funereal colors, is as receptacles of spirituality. They're imposing, full of presence, like monoliths. You're bound to surrender to them. I think critic Robert Hughes was on to something when he described them as being about "emptiness."

You can bake this in one big pouch, but two smaller pouches is easier to handle. Best of all, probably, is to make an individual serving pouch for each person at the table.

"Moreso than the surfaces being different, I've been playing well and have been very confident," he said. "I feel like my results are going to be very solid. Grass is a surface that players play the least on.

I have done well on clay, but I do think I can play on grass as well."

* When Hitchcock took over on Nov. 8, he installed a system that featured short shifts to avoid having players out on the ice too long, dragging and vulnerable. The fresher the legs the faster the tempo, and with Hitch as coach the Blues had more shifts per game than any NHL team. The same is true in the NHL postseason. The Blues have taken 1,898 shifts through four games, most among the 16 postseason teams. That's an average 474.5 shifts per game, the most by any of the 16 postseason teams. San Jose is averaging 435.8 shifts per game. On at least one occasion the Blues caught the Sharks in a long, tiring shift and it played a role in B.J. Crombeen's goal that gave the Blues a 1-0 lead in Game 4.

During our interview, she sat with fellow retiree Gwendolyn Windom, who's 67 and started working at the plant in 1970 as a single mother with three children. Windom suffered an on-the-job concussion so severe she had to stay in a darkened room for six months while her mother moved in to care for the children. She later had surgery to rebuild the arch of her left foot and had two disks removed from her back.

Wait . . . they were restricted? Yes, absolutely. The new freedom is easy to see even when you use the new iPad to run old old apps that haven't been optimized in any way. iOS renders all standard text and and all standard user elements at Retina quality automatically. The change can be transformative. River Of News, a Google Reader client that was last updated four months ago, is practically a new app. The left-hand column of subscriptions that once was a little too small and a little too difficult to read now looks like shrewd design.

Hard to believe, spring training is already here. You know what that means, right? Only a few more weeks until the NFL draft. … My synopsis of the baseball season: (1) Pitchers and catchers report, (2) Spring training games commence, (3) Opening Day, (4) Pirates mathematically eliminated. … Did you see where Cheat, er, Chad Knaus, Jimmie Johnson's perennially rule-breaking crew chief, has been suspended and fined yet again by NASCAR? My question: When are drivers like Johnson going to start getting suspended for employing underhanded cheaters? I've said it before and I'll say again: What's the difference between Barry Bonds claiming he didn't know what his trainer was giving him to enhance his body and Jimmie Johnson claiming he didn't know what his crew chief was doing to enhance his chassis? … The issue isn't that the Red Sox banned beer from their clubhouse earlier this week; it's why baseball teams allow beer in the clubhouse in the first place. Just lends credence to what I've always contended: Baseball - the only sport where you can play 162 games and gain weight.

Their performances are the only things in the film that don't feel processed and sterilized and safe.

There's some individual line matchups that are going to go on, but I think it's more focus on your own team."

I often bracket my trips to Hawaii with a stay in the Honolulu area on the way in and out. Arriving in Hawaii, I like the Moana Surfrider, The Breakers or the Outrigger Reef to jump right into the ocean and enjoy a little nightlife.

They didn't even make the standard call in the week before the draft to get an updated phone number. But they are close to the LSU coaches and had all the information they needed. When Blackmon was off the board for the Rams at No. 6, the pick was for sale.

Gregg, a retired lawyer, and Peter, a college librarian in Gainesville, Fla., drove to Everglades City a day early to claim our camping spots.

So we chose a beach site on an island encouragingly named Jewel Key, due west, dead into the wind.

Defensively, everywhere the Blazers took the ball they found another layer of defense to overcome – usually unsuccessfully. When Portland found a brief crack in the Lakers’ interior defense, it quickly closed with multiple players there to dig at the ball and contest the shot when it did go up. When the ball went back out to the perimeter the Lakers swarmed even harder by trapping the ball when possible or just pressuring the ball handler into a difficult position when it wasn’t. It started with Ron Artest’s smothering defense on Brandon Roy who was locked down by Artest from the opening tip. Wherever Roy went he found Ron clamped onto him in a position to contest his every move.

In the smaller Nissan Versa, for example, I averaged a very good 38.3 mpg, but that car was about as flavorful as cottage cheese. In the revamped and very well thought-out Hyundai Elantra, which is also rated at up to 40 mpg highway, I averaged 31.3 mpg.

Carter got his start working at Automatic Data Processing and then later CompuPay in Manhattan. But while working at both firms "taught me a lot," he saw that he could streamline their business model.
The two made the dolls kiss before checking to see if the McGraw doll was anatomically correct. "There's nothing there," Paisley said in amazement.
-- And you get a similar laundry list of enrollment and heavy-use "bonuses."
Q: As a usually optimistic Marlins fan, it is difficult for me to think like this, but overlooking the entire franchise, it does not seem to be in good shape. It also seems that there is not enough heat on Larry Beinfest. He has whiffed on nearly every first round pick in his entire career with the Fish. Can you tell me why this front office is still highly regarded? Obviously there are not enough people who care about baseball down here in South Florida to really create an issue.

Monsanto Co., the world's largest seed company, reported an early estimate of fiscal first-quarter profit that topped analysts' estimates amid 'strength" in its businesses in Brazil and Argentina and changes to cottonseed pricing in Australia.
3. Green Flash Rayon Vert: A last-minute addition to this list, Green Flash's brand-new Belgian-style pale ale is scheduled to arrive in St. Louis next week. I predict it will be a big hit. The brewery experimented for four years before perfecting the recipe for this hop-forward beer with lively carbonation and a healthy dose of Brettanomyces funk. 7 percent ABV; available year-round.

"Today's posturing makes it clear that the company and the auto task force would rather discount the thousands of individual investors and retirees who own GM bonds than undergo earnest negotiations," a committee of GM bondholders said in a news release. The group said the 10 percent offer was "neither reasonable nor adequate."
"I got mixed up with the wrong group of friends, and I made bad choices, and I ended up running away," he said. He and his friend, a fellow foster child, would "couch-hop" and party for weeks. Then, he would turn himself in "to eat and sleep" for a few days before leaving for the streets again.
And it also takes a special person once the student/athlete gets on campus. The work to get into an Ivy institution is difficult and time-consuming, but after that, the road gets even more bumpy … then add in football.
The tentative daily camp schedule will be off-field camp activities from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. for fourth, fifth and sixth graders regarding film study, strength and conditioning, simulated pro combine tests with awards, ultimate football and guest speakers.
How U.S. House members from Ohio voted on the health care bill:
Ohio's chief election official, Secretary of State Jon Husted, says that means McFaul was not entitled to use $127,000 in leftover campaign funds to help pay restitution in a 2010 plea deal. The law allows excess campaign money to be donated to political parties, other politicians or charities. Period.

If you think all of this seems to be coming out of the blue, you're not alone, because much of the debate is taking place behind the walls of cloistered academia. Indeed, sometimes you don't even realize that there's a social revolution going on until you find yourself in the middle of one. That's what's happened to me.

I'd like to tell about the morning the baboons came to call, and the morning I woke up with a tree frog on my head, but I'm supposed to write about local things, so two columns about Zambia is pushing it. Still, I'm fortunate that my world sometimes includes a whole different continent, and therefore "My World" has to reflect that.

I realize the state had to cut a lot of corners to save money on the huge project, and I'm sure having pretty railings wasn't a top priority, but maybe a more grassroots effort can help build something that actually looks good there.

So, yeah, there’s a Ben Stiller comedy (“Neighborhood Watch”) another self-promoting Tyler Perry movie (“Tyler Perry’s The Matchmaker”) and further who-asked-for-‘em sequels to “Ice Age” and “Step Up.” Oh, and “Ted,” a twisted comedy with Mark Wahlberg and a talking teddy bear that sounds like “The Beaver,” only less so.
He rolled right and then, instead of scrambling for the yards that might have put Minnesota in field goal range, threw across the field to the left. Tracy Porter picked it off to send the game to overtime, where Garrett Hartley's 40-yard field goal put the Saints into their first Super Bowl.

After Kotelman was released on bond from the DUI charge, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers charged him with possession of wildlife and two counts of violating fish and wildlife rules. They took custody of the monkey.
Bombshell doesn't begin to describe what CDOT dropped. If carried out — money is always an issue — this new I-70 will change the profile of the city. It will open up neighborhoods that have languished in the viaduct's shadow. It's a huge improvement and a bold move. Think of that: a bold move from a bureaucracy.
The agency trains employees of Safe Place sites, teaching managers how to identify troubled behavior and then reach out to children and teens in a nonthreatening way. They are also trained to respect confidentiality and are told of services that are available to the children. Managers then take that training to employees.

For their part, the players had no real interest in making a new deal through bargaining sessions with the owners. That became obvious Friday when they walked away from mediation sessions even though the owners seemingly tried to make enough concessions to keep the talks going.
It was during his time as a teacher that he had his only experiences with pot. He was at a couple of parties where people were smoking - this was in the early '70s, which were still part of the '60s - so he took a couple of hits. It didn't do anything for him.
Budget Moms make more than 70 percent of the household purchasing decisions and account for some 80 percent of consumer spending. They fill up the family car with gas and know the high price at the pump is a result of this administration's failed energy policy.

For Huntington, which reported a profitable first quarter, the deal provides a tax benefit and a way to invest in communities. Affordable-housing developers rely on grants, loans, tax credits and subsidies to make low monthly rents possible at new apartments and renovated properties. Developers who obtain tax credits through the Ohio Housing Finance Agency, and comparable housing groups in other states, sell those credits to raise money for their projects. The buyers are banks and other businesses that can use the credits to offset what they owe in taxes.
Medco shareholders would receive $71.36 per share in cash and stock, or $29.1 billion, based on the stock's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange when the merger was announced last July 21.

Your home run in Game 4 of that '63 Series in Dodger Stadium off Whitey Ford was huge. It gave you the lead in a game the Dodgers won, 2-1. What do you recall of that moment?
Nobody really wants this, but the Republicans in Washington seem to think they do. But why now when the debt ceiling has been raised seven times in the past decade under George W. Bush without anyone batting an eye? Where was the scrutiny and the concern when the previous president decided to wage two wars while at the same time cutting revenues by allowing tax breaks and loopholes favoring the very wealthy and "too big to fail" corporations, which have reaped enormous profits at the expense of our citizens and the environment? Where was the outrage when the housing market was ballooning to an obvious breaking point and average citizens began to see their wages stagnate or slip?
Next act: The crisis slowed the packaging of mortgages and other assets into securities but won't stop it. Still, investors now demand more information about these deals and higher returns. Critics want more regulation of hedge funds, those secretive partnerships that seem to pop up in each crisis.

John Kriesel, R-Cottage Grove, who has been carrying the House bill along with Lanning, said there's a "decent chance" of rounding up the votes. "We're just going to have to go to those maybes and get 'em," he said.
I have seen isolated ACL tears in 5-year-olds, but this is a very rare age to sustain this injury. The slightly older 7- to 9-year-old group seems to suffer the injury with greater frequency. Both boys and girls seem at risk. Although an ACL may be torn during any activity, the most common causes in this age group seem to be related to gymnastics, trampoline, bicycle and football activities.
Meyer calls it the "circle drill" because the spectators encircle the combatants. Marty Schottenheimer called it the "nutcracker" when he coached the Browns. At other places, it is called the "bull ring."
On Sunday, members started meeting in a roomy new building at 3131 E. 23rd St. in Granite City with space for 600 in the sanctuary; the nondenominational church has about 125 people attending services. By contrast, latecomers at the old location, 3237 W. Chain of Rocks Road, sometimes had to stand.

"Fez" is almost Hemingway-esque in its spare gameplay style. There's nothing wasted when it comes to narrative and design. Every screen has a purpose. Every corner tells the player something about the world or offers another clue. If you see a fox jumping over a lazy dog, Polytron puts it there for a reason.
Then I add in the Golden Globes (knowing they’re a joke, but realizing all the Hollywood hype they create) and the awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (because the industry is so full of, and intimidated by, British talent). I also look at the prizes given out by the industry’s three big professional groups — the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild and the Producers Guild.
So, let me propose one paradigm-shifting idea: What if we, the Columbia Basin, created the conditions for watershed communities to be the main economic beneficiaries from salmon recovery? Each sub-basin and the political jurisdictions that make it up could be shareholders in watershed trusts. These trusts would grow (or not) depending on the number and quality of salmon and salmon-enhancing habitat improvements they produced and maintained over time.
This recipe can be made a day ahead. Allow to cool completely, then wrap and refrigerate then reheat gently, adding more liquid if necessary. If you can find tiny enoki mushrooms, they make a nice addition with their little round tops bobbing in the gravy.

A dry-goods warehouse in Jessup that supplies Giant Food grocery stores and employs about 250 people will close in June, the operator, Jessup Logistics LLC, said Wednesday.
"According to new information brought to my attention, some witnesses now suggest that the versions of events attributed to them in CPD reports from 2004 were not accurate, including one witness who now claims that his observations during one of the lineups conducted were not accurately memorialized in police reports," Alvarez wrote. "To be clear, at this point, I have no objective evidence to support the notion that there was any misfeasance or malfeasance on the part of investigators in this case. However, with this new information, it is my belief that an independent investigation from a separate police agency is clearly warranted to ensure that we reach the truth in this case."
1986: In NASA's first post-Challenger launch, an unmanned Delta rocket lost power in its main engine shortly after liftoff, forcing safety officers to destroy it by remote control.

In March 1944, a 500-pound bomb accidentally detonated, killing five men and a woman. In 1984, four children entered and stole a small quantity of explosives that later detonated, injuring three of them.

For Dusty Watt, it's all in a season's work.
The acting County Department head received a $25,529 raise, the Department of Parks Assistant Director received a $20,000 raise, and the number of individuals making over $100,000 has jumped from 31 to 131 since 2000,” President Wowkanech reported. “This is outrageous.”
The 2011 draft class lacked the can't-miss left tackle such as the Miami Dolphins' Jake Long and the Cleveland Browns' Joe Thomas, so Angelo did the next best thing. By landing Carimi with the 29th overall pick, he injected attitude into a toothless unit that not only allowed a league-high 56 sacks but failed to consistently open holes in the running game.
State and federal government probes of the San Bruno disaster are complete, but the state utilities commission opened a separate investigation into PG&E's gas-system records, which the blast investigations revealed to be in disarray.
The U.S. ambassador to Honduras, Lisa Kubiske, is responsible for bringing order to the complex and sometimes competing mix of interagency programs, and she oversees compliance with human rights legislation. She described the Honduran armed forces as "eager and capable partners in this joint effort."
City Hall’s real estate sweepstakes: Downtown developers are looking for tenants, any tenants, to fill a new office project. The city, it just so happens, may be in the market for new office space. The Bureau of Planning & Sustainability and the Bureau of Development Services live in the city’s 1900 S.W. Fourth Ave. building, a short walk south of City Hall. Portland State University would like to take over the building. So, the two bureaus may at some point need a home. Leonard has been in talks with developer Brad Malsin about potentially moving the BDS to a project at the east end of the Burnside Bridge. The Bureau of Environmental Services, now in the Portland Building next door to City Hall, may be in the market, too. Developers Jim Winkler and Bob Naito have been trying for years to break ground on a PDC-backed project called One Waterfront Place just north of the Broadway Bridge. The word around the building is that Winkler is trying to recruit BES to help anchor his building. All of this and more will be on the table at a council work session at 2 p.m. Thursday. Office space planning has always been a challenge for the city given that each bureau answers to a different elected leader and they typically don’t coordinate their moves well. The work session is an attempt, for now at least, to improve that coordination.

"Get a divorce," joked Weisl when asked the blogger's question. Weisl recommends Lacrima Di Morro d'Alba, a red wine from Italy that smells almost like a Gewurztraminer, is dry and medium-bodied with floral notes that drinks like a well-made Cru Beaujolais. Other lighter Italian wines could include a Refosco or a Grignolino, also medium-bodied and dry. Another compromise is rosé, and although many people prefer that wine in the summer, a good rosé can be terrific with the right food any time of the year.
Despite the turnaround, growth won't be sufficient to prevent America's unemployment rate -- now at a 26-year high of 9.8 percent -- from rising. Economists predict it will hit 9.9 percent when the government releases the latest snapshot on employment conditions on Friday. It's expected to top 10 percent this year.
The agreement is significant not only for the goal of ending hazardous discharges, but also for symbolic reasons, said Joel Tickner, a University of Massachusetts-Lowell associate professor of community health and sustainability.
Last year GM offered to buy back Volts from any customers worried about safety. In January the automaker advised Volt owners to take the cars to a dealer for free repairs. Steel was added to plates that protect the batteries, which GM said provided additional protection to minimize fire risk.

We stood on the other side of the river. There was a house up the hill, and we broke the windows out and shot across the river at the Germans. We couldn't see anybody; we just wanted to give them trouble.
In general, our servers were friendly and professional, and one good buffing away from polished. Questions about the food were answered, though not always correctly. When we asked what "Painted Hills" was, since it appeared on the menu with the flat iron steak ($24.95), our waiter replied, "It's a farm."
Nelson and Breazeal underwent the surgery last Tuesday at Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Wash. Both are now recovering in their homes.
some expected based on the 18 games the Cardinals and Brewers played against each other the regular season. A few of those became beanball exchanges, and all of them had a certain edge. This series has lacked a bit of that feistiness -- lustily booing Nyjer Morgan is about as chippy as the Busch crowd has gotten so far -- but the Gomez slide and now Zack Greinke plunking David Freese could be adding some cayenne to these churchy festivities.
Investigators say he stole tens of thousands of dollars in merchandise from retails stores across Oregon and Washington, and sold the goods on his eBay site called "myotherjob2001."
The suit seeks a court order to compel federal pipeline safety officials to set performance standards for state regulators who oversee gas transmission lines.
In another game, Greer noticed that one team was doubling LaMarcus Aldridge in a way that left Miller wide open in the corner. Greer suggested an offensive tweak that shifted Miller to the weakside and Nicolas Batum -- a much better three-point shooter -- to the opening in the corner.

The proposed class-action settlement would give aggrieved owners $100 to $200 each and a $1,000 credit toward the purchase of a new car. Legal fees in the class action would give trial lawyers $8.5 million, Peters said.
Check for carp: Lake Erie boaters are complaining about being checked, while Ohio's U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is complaining that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is not checking trucks for illegal loads of live U.S.-raised Asian carp destined for Canadian markets. Last year, Brown called on Canada to do more. In a letter to acting Commissioner David Aguilar of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Brown said U.S. enforcement officers need to do their part in stopping the high-risk shipments of the invasive carp.
The worst provision in Mr. Schoeller's bill would take away the long-held right of Missourians who request absentee ballots to vote by mail. These folks already are registered to vote. Some of them are disabled and can't get to the polls. Others are members of the military, stationed far from home, perhaps even overseas protecting the very right to vote that Mr. Schoeller seeks to diminish.
Guevara, a physician with no formal military training, was also something else, critics say: prolific executioner, dogmatic totalitarian and co-designer of the Cuban police state and indoctrination apparatus.
"I know that many of you are greatly — and rightly — concerned about the recent shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, a young man whose future has been lost to the ages," Holder told the 14th annual convention of the National Action Network.
The wildly (and deservedly) popular Sunset Grille is here. A sprawling waterside expanse of dining rooms and decks, the upscale restaurant is impeccably operated and managed, a pleasure to visit. Nearby, the homier Harborside Bar & Grille, famous for its orange "crushes," attracts locals and visitors alike. It was a Harborside bartender who made sure I stopped by the Shark at the Harbor, local-food champion that moved across the bay a few years ago, and tipped me off to what turned out to be my favorite stop of the weekend, the one-of-a-kind Shrimp Boat, a roadside wonder that Joe Crochetti started over 20 years ago.
"That's not what I thought life was about," said Ruffner, human resources manager for the Troy-based firm, this year's No. 1 Top Workplace for small businesses. "Here, they believe in family balance, and they live it, breathe it, and the owners encourage it."

“We knew that we were going to staff this one,” said Sorge after the contest. “Sometimes when you get backed up with some rainouts you hate to have, particularly, your better guys sit and wait. We’ll just keep them on a rotation and get their work in. We’ve got conference games on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, so today, instead of them ‘penning’ (‘bull-penning’) them, (we put them) on some inning counts. They just went out there (pointing to the pitcher’s mound) to do some work instead of doing it over there (motioning to the bullpen). I think we could have thrown in the bullpen, but you get a little bit different juice flowing through your veins when you’re out there in a game. So that’s obviously a little bit more productive.”
Ginger Koryta, 63, said she was most concerned that her granddaughter had a good time on her honeymoon. Now that she was home, she had two goals.

Ah, but Billingslea's delivery of the wooing speech is an aria of delight. And he and Marker escalate the deception of the husband with insidious skill. It isn't often that Iago's ploys win audible gasps of horror from an opening night audience.

Brocklebank was shooting for the Irish music magazine Hot Press in 1978 when he attended several of U2's first Dublin gigs and became their occasional roadie. His first photo on Sept. 9, 1978, is of a muscle-shirted Bono, mike in hand, performing as the opening act for English punk rockers The Stranglers in front of a foul crowd of hard-core punks. U2 was paid 50 Irish pounds (about $80) for the gig.

It attracts a young and boisterous crowd. Think of it as Meat's fun younger brother. 1761 Frankfort Ave., 502-259-9540; http://www.whiskeybythedrink.com

When the fungus has rotted away the stump, you could remove the structure, unless you end up liking it there.

The issue erupted about three years ago, when Planned Parenthood of the Heartland pioneered a system to allow big-city doctors to distribute abortion pills to patients in small-town clinics.

All four teams have gotten here by playing a certain way.”
In particular, researchers point to prisoners of war on terror-related activities as potential subjects for the fMRI lie-detecting methods. Greely and Wolpe agree that there is "little doubt" the U.S. government has been studying them. "We have a technology now that, under certain circumstances and in certain ways, allows us to look at activities of the brain and deduce things that previously we never could have understood from a person without communicating with them," Wolpe said.

There were teeny tostada rounds mounded high with diced raw hamachi ringing with lime aioli, pico de Gallo and chile piquin. The meatballs glazed in ancho-cranberry barbecue sauce hid the surprise of melty Oaxaca cheese inside. Tender skewered octopus were most notable for the presentation — the octo-kebab sliced into oblong coins for maximum tentacle crisp-age. The carnitas tacos were tender from their beer, Coke and orange juice braise. Chicken enchiladas came beneath an ebony shine of my new favorite mole poblano, its mysteriously blend of 25 ingredients (from mulatto chiles to hazelnuts, figs, pepitas and tomatillos) in sharper balance than Cantina’s sweeter suburban rendition.

And why would they? The human soul, far from fixed, linear and predisposed to suspicion and doubt, is instead a fluxive, malleable, infinitely evolving thing, matching the insane, kaleidoscopic sweep of life itself. To lock the human heart into a cage of timid ideology or rigid sexual conduct, to forcibly limit its capacity for love is one of the most oppressive things you can ever do. Just ask the Catholic church.

øDrawing from actual events in Van Gogh's life, Laurence Anholt's book weaves a story about how a little boy named Camille befriends the artist. Camille and his family appeared in paintings created by Van Gogh. This interactive story reveals how, although Van Gogh painted vibrant paintings of the village people and its surroundings, the townspeople of Camille's village thought the painter was odd and ostracized him. But Camille and his family accepted Van Gogh and saw the genius of his work. The book contains 19 puzzles which kids play to bring the characters within the book to life. By tapping illustrations of characters, kids can activate a mode that lets them see the gears and mechanisms that would make the character move. By tapping again on the character, the mechanisms spring apart so that kids can connect them once again. When they do, the character will now appear to animate in the story. Kids can also use simple art tools to repaint the characters so that they appear on the pages how they would like them to look. With soothing background music and the ability to be transported to a museum for closer inspection of Van Gogh's work, this is a great way for kids to learn about this artist and 10 of his famous paintings.

To transform the posters into art, the artists grouped headlines by common terms—say, murder—and arranged them into grids that sit atop eerie photographs of brick walls, tilted windows and alleyways.

A strolling violinist provides acoustic effects at Restaurant Europa while orange-hued walls and copper-topped tables accent the decor. A frigid room devoted solely to drinking shots of vodka suggests a party atmosphere. The menu, meanwhile, features many Old World dishes that are likely to be familiar to native Eastern Europeans. Yet I'd venture to guess that the flavor and style of such fare will appeal to others in the county, no matter their heritage. The Russian salad, served cold, is an excellent example. A small mound of diced eggs, pickles and chicken is studded with peas and bound together with well-seasoned mayo. Pickled eggplant plays the starring role in another delicious salad served very cold and featuring tomatoes and carrots in a thick, sweet dressing. Borscht, a soup of beets and cabbage, is another fine way to launch a meal at Restaurant Europa. Stewed tomatoes and sliced carrots play supporting roles in several dishes I sampled, including the excellent stuffed cabbage. The robust dish also features good minced beef and rice encased in tender cabbage leaves. Carb-laden dishes extend to desserts, the best among them is blini -- fried bread that's stuffed with filling and rolled up in the manner of a crepe or blintz. Service is friendly and knowledgeable.-- David Farkas, Special to The Plain Dealer

I'm disappointed with the soup at many places, but here the combinations are so enticing I had to order it on each visit. The first time it was cream of asparagus teetering on the edge of rosemary overload; the second was sausage and farro with a rich tomato broth that was good but could have been absolutely lyrical with a little more restraint with the herbs. On my third visit, the soup was an exceptional black bean ($7) that took on the meaty character of the accompanying bits of chorizo with a swirl of chile cream and scallions in the center to smooth it all out.

Think about that one: A sizable share of Republicans might actually support a prospective nominee whom they recognize to be fundamentally deficient. Perhaps this is easily explained.

The survey results confirm what area players have known since the place went public in 1963: Sleepy ranks as one of the best challenges in the area. It is demanding but fair. You will find plenty of trouble if you are not accurate, from the many deep ravines to the 58 bunkers that strategically dot the course.

Still, the evening’s best moments were provided by artists who were willing to stretch out and let their songs develop. Drake, whose set sometimes felt like a Young Money Records exhibition, saved his best for last: a solo performance of “Over,” the lead single from his upcoming debut. “Over” requires Drake to express surprise, annoyance and bewilderment at his sudden success; given space to act, he sold the complicated sentiment to the crowd. Ludacris’ solid performance was structured like a mainstream pop concert: hit after discrete hit, with explanatory introductions setting up the songs.

Ohio is not alone in its ideological wheel spinning, either. Instead of working to bring relief to homeowners suffering from foreclosure or ease the suffocating burden of unemployment, our federal counterparts have been busy pointing fingers and playing a dangerous game of political chicken with our economy. Of course, the debt ceiling should have been raised, as it has been under the Reagans and Clintons of history, but tying its passage to a cuts-only deal with no plan to boost economic growth or create jobs is unfair and irresponsible.

Seau, a 12-time NFL Pro Bowler, had struggled to adapt to life after a 20-year professional football career. He drove his SUV off an embankment in October 2010 after being arrested on suspicion of domestic assault.

Marriage between a man and a woman has its origins firmly grounded in the objective reality of human nature. Our human reason informs us that man and woman are made for each other. They complement each other physically and socially. Only the sexual union of a man and a woman can bring a new life into the world. Assistive reproductive technologies do not alter this reality any more than airplanes alter the reality of gravity.

The latest edition of Baseball America paints a devastating picture of the Sox' lack of commitment to the international market (especially when compared to the Rangers). How long, realistically, will it take for the team to close the gap? It's an important question given the obvious lack of talent on the major league roster. Michael Peregrine, Glencoe

You may need a lab coat to fully appreciate Mandalay Bay’s newest epicurean experience, Fleur. From the mind of culinary whiz and “Top Chef Masters” cheftestant Hubert Keller, Fleur is Sin City’s first restaurant to offer cocktails infused with liquid nitrogen. Even without a degree in chemistry you can enjoy the outlandish tableside presentation that freezes your drink into a delicious boozy sorbet. After imbibing like a mad scientist, try one of Fleur’s signature flights. The aptly named Decadent Flight includes white chocolate, chocolate coconut and espresso martinis. The restaurant also features one of Vegas’ largest collections of absinthe, as well as a secluded wine room that houses more than 3,500 vintages. We’re told the menu of gourmet small plates is impressive as well, but we were too mesmerized by the nitrogen infusions to make it to our table.

You order at the counter at this crazy-quilt colorful eatery blooming with bright landscape paintings, parrot sculptures, mural-topped communal tables and bouncy Mexican music, but that doesn't mean fast food.

Lohse led the Cardinals' rotation in wins and he had the lowest ERA of the staff. He did that despite being skipped, pushed back and generally jerked around at times during the season. As much as his numbers look good against his peers, the way the club shifted him around and took care to skip his start at one point is just as revealing. The club was, midway through the season, concerned about his inconsistency. Manager Tony La Russa at one point suggested that he felt Lohse was ailing physically but not acknowledging it to the team. Lohse insisted that he didn't seek treatment from the trainers because he didn't need it.

A few days before the MCA opening, Johnson stood in the center of a gallery and cast a seriously-don't-talk-to-me-now look on his face.

Still, the addition of three-time Pro Bowl receiver Brandon Marshall ate up quite a bit of salary-cap space for the Bears. He'll count $9.5 million in 2012. The Bears could, however, convert that high base salary into a signing bonus, lower his base salary to the veteran minimum of $715,000 and save about $5.8 million in space. But, the Bears would create problems in 2013, since Marshall's projected base salary is $9.3 million.

The veteran rock guitarist isn’t above indulging in mid-Eighties lite-metal cliché. He still likes to punctuate verses with single, quavering, overdriven high notes. But on Wednesday night, his leads were particularly lyrical: his spotlight moment on “Wanted Dead Or Alive” demonstrated everything Sambora does well. He can still crash into a song like a stallion kicking down a barn door. When he slows down – which, admittedly, isn’t too often – his solos can be melodic, soaring, cathartic.

He saw a man sitting next to the water tower, with his back to him. The man was on his knees. Boynton couldn't see what he was doing. He walked quietly down the path as not to bother the man. Just as he got to the other side of the tower, the man said, "Hey you," or something to that effect. Boynton replied: "Hmmm, what?" "And he gets up and he looks all disheveled and I don't know, just tired and all shaking and he walked up to me and as he walked down to me, he was walking slowly... I could see red on his hand... red all smeared on his shirt." When the man was about 10 feet from Boynton, he said: "I am going to kill you." Boynton said the man looked right in his eyes as he said it. "And I said, 'Why would you kill me? I haven't done anything to you.' And he looked kind of angry and confused. I didn't know what to think so I was kind of inching away. I said: 'Sorry. I haven't done anything to you.' "
To further justify changing the law, Maag and supporters argue that Ohio's conceal carry law is not applied uniformly and is more restrictive than the laws in other states.

For years, I wrote to the sound of tango music from the '20s and '30s — Don Barreto, Roberto Firpo, Ada Falcón and, of course, the king of them all, Carlos Gardel, who died in a plane crash in 1935. Not that I'd ever been to Argentina at that point: I just loved the music. And when I moved to L.A. and found a restaurant named for the singer near West Hollywood, I had to try it. That was 1996, just after the Bozoghlian family from Buenos Aires bought the place and turned it into one of the most welcoming, and festive, restaurants in town.

Under the 1st Amendment, they add, any ambiguity should be resolved in her favor. This would be a harder case to make to the court if Stewart had been openly contemptuous of her conviction or if she had said she would violate the law in the future; the judicial system long has taken remorse (or its absence) into account when it comes to sentencing. But her actual comments don't justify a quadrupling of her sentence. The appeals court needs to make sure that the harsher punishment wasn't a reaction to Stewart's assertiveness or her ideological identification with her client.

Gorgonzola-Stuffed Dates combine salty, pungent cheese with toasty almonds or walnuts in another do-ahead dessert nibble that can also shine on a cheese display or as an hors d'oeuvre. The Gorgonzola lends salt to the sweet date, while the nut adds crunch; using walnuts instead of almonds gives a hint of tannin, which can help offset tannins when paired with a young vintage port. Ruby port and late harvest Zinfandel are other dessert wine choices for the stuffed dates.

The film opens by introducing the rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais), who recites his morning prayers on a prayer rug, undergoes a grueling physical workout, and then tenderly kisses his pregnant wife goodbye.

Are the Blazers interested in real answers on Oden? Are they willing to explain to their ticket-buying fan base what they think is happening with their center? Beyond that, is Oden himself getting an accurate picture? You certainly hope the answers are yes, but we've passed through the threshold of waving things off as just a "freak injury" long ago when it comes to Oden. You now have to wonder if the franchise's desire to justify Oden's as the No.1 pick three years ago is what's driving some of this.

The national debt has grown significantly in recent years and it keeps rising at this very moment. The way that people get into debt is from spending and I believe that the U.S. has been spending too much. I am not very involved with politics or with the government, but from what I have seen, the U.S. is spending a great deal of money on useless things. I think it is time for major spending cuts. They need to start using their spending money to repay all the countries they have borrowed from in the past. If the spending does not stop, then the U.S. will continue to go further in to debt. With out all the useless spending, the U.S. can save some of that money to pay off the debt that has grown significantly. They can start to pay it off slowly, but a little at a time is better than nothing. I am just a high school student so I understand that my knowledge of economics is basic. However, this is the only solution that makes sense to me.

But the script – peppered with Poe references (some of which have to be explained), is fun, especially for Poe fans, who might be tempted to cast a jaundiced eye on this endeavor. Still, if the movies can give us H.G. Wells as a real time traveler (“Time After Time”), why not a Poe who is a lover, a man of action, an amateur sleuth who sacrifices all for art and love?

It's not just a Generation Y problem. According to the New York Fed's report, 5.3 percent of the 37 million borrowers are age 60 and over, and another 11.8 percent are 50 to 59. This doesn't necessarily mean that boomers are going back to school (or still paying off their loans from the 1970s). Rather, it may be one sign that parents are increasingly taking out loans to pay for their kids' educations. According to a February report from the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, 17 percent of parents whose children graduated in 2010 took out loans, up from 5.6 percent in 1992-93.

Perot became a caricature, thanks to his own erratic behavior and comedian Dana Carvey's devastating portrayal. So it's easy to forget that in May 1992, the Texan led both incumbent George H.W.

We had a long running discussion about how dangerous my spiky plant obsession would be when we finally adopted a pug, since they have such buggy eyes. When I mentioned starting a blog it took him about 3 minutes to come up with the name, it was perfect on so many levels. I garden on the edge of what is hardy here in Portland, which is emotionally dangerous (watching plants you love die a slow death isn't something I'd recommend). And, the money I can spend on plants, also a bit dangerous, financially.

Although he became the starting left tackle during his sophomore year, Reiff definitely has the talent to play either side, which could help improve his draft stock. He comes from Iowa, where the Kirk Ferentz offensive line pedigree is nothing to shake a stick at.

Maybe it's the slightly soulless nature of motion-capture films (though that's been greatly improved upon since the dead-in-the-eyes days of "The Polar Express"), but while the adventurous aspects are slam-bang, the characters don't connect in the same way Indy does. Spielberg is such an imaginative storyteller that "Tintin" can't help but be fun to watch. You just wish he'd slow down and let us catch our breath a little every now and then.
There's a bigger issue here: Why do so many reporters and pundits from somewhere else like to depict us as washed-up and warmed-over in the Midwest? Too many narratives about our region begin with landscapes of cornfields and rusted factories, and end with ruminations about our low self-esteem. These tales of our looming extinction are really annoying to all of us who are still very much alive.

Now, Oregon will tell you that it believes it has the greatest talent pool around. But the Ducks -- who haven't had a first-round selection since Jonathan Stewart in 2008 -- don't. And what we've learned in the past three seasons by watching the success on the field fail to translate into high-caliber NFL picks is that Kelly doesn't need all the best players to win big. He doesn't even need a half dozen of them. He just needs some pretty good football players, and maybe, a small number of guys who have a chance to play in the NFL someday.

One hopeful sign is the 53% increase in the number of banks availing themselves of the loans. That suggests many smaller banks across the Continent participated for the first time.

When I asked about the tasting menu, the waiter was vague, saying hesitantly that it changed nightly, and then rattling off several items such as squab, foie gras and butterfish that might be included.
